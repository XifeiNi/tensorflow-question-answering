It is located at South Africa House , a building on Trafalgar Square , London . As well as containing the offices of the High Commissioner , the building also hosts the South African consulate . It has been a Grade II * Listed Building since 1982 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 See also </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> <Li> 4 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> South Africa House was built by Holland , Hannen & Cubitts in the 1930s on the site of what had been Morley \\'s Hotel until it was demolished in 1936 . The building was designed by Sir Herbert Baker , with architectural sculpture by Coert Steynberg and Sir Charles Wheeler , and opened in 1933 . The building was acquired by the government of South Africa as its main diplomatic presence in the UK . During World War II , Prime Minister Jan Smuts lived there while conducting South Africa \\'s war plans . </P> <P> In 1961 , South Africa became a republic , and withdrew from the Commonwealth due to its policy of racial segregation . Accordingly , the building became an Embassy , rather than a High Commission . During the 1980s , the building , which was one of the only South African diplomatic missions in a public area , was targeted by protesters from around the world . During the 1990 Poll Tax Riots , the building was set alight by rioters , although not seriously damaged . </P> <P> The first fully free democratic elections in South Africa were held on the 27 April 1994 , and 4 days later , the country rejoined the Commonwealth , 33 years to the day after it withdrew upon becoming a republic . Along with country \\'s diplomatic missions in other Commonwealth countries , the mission once again became a High Commission . </P> <P> Today , South Africa House is no longer a controversial site , and is the focal point of South African culture in the UK . South African President Nelson Mandela appeared on the balcony of South Africa House in 1996 , as part of his official UK state visit . In 2001 , Mandela again appeared on the balcony of South Africa House to mark the seventh anniversary of Freedom Day , when the apartheid system was officially abolished . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of diplomatic missions of South Africa </Li> <Li> High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom </Li> <Li> High Commission of Uganda , London </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to South Africa House , London . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` The London Diplomatic List \\'\\' ( PDF ) . 14 December 2013 .

It originally aired on NBC on April 21 , 2011 . The episode was written and directed by co-executive producer Mindy Kaling . `` Michael \\'s Last Dundies \\'\\' guest stars Will Ferrell as Deangelo Vickers and Jack Coleman as State Senator Robert Lipton . </P> <P> The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) trains his office replacement , Deangelo Vickers ( Ferrell ) on how to properly host the branch \\'s annual Dundie Awards . Michael soon learns that Deangelo has a terrible problem with speaking in front of others . Meanwhile , Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) grows to dislike her boyfriend , Gabe Lewis ( Zach Woods ) . </P> <P> The episode -- which was originally going to be called `` Goodbye , Michael Part 1 \\'\\' -- was the first installment in the series to be both written and directed by Kaling , who also portrays Kelly Kapoor on the series . The episode also marks the second appearance of Ferrell as Deangelo Vickers ; Ferrell had signed onto the series to make Carell \\'s exit transition easier . The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics . `` Michael \\'s Last Dundies \\'\\' was viewed by 6.849 million viewers and received a 3.3 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49 . The episode was the highest - rated NBC series of the week that it aired , as well as the sixth-most watched episode in the 18 -- 49 demographic for the week it aired . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Production </Li> <Li> 3 Cultural references </Li> <Li> 4 Reception </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> At the office , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) announces to the employees that Deangelo Vickers ( Will Ferrell ) will be his co-host at the Dundies . The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees . The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo , but Michael insists he take the job . Michael brings some of the staff together in the conference room to help Deangelo get prepared for the show , but he struggles to be humorous . Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) tries to help him , saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting , but Michael objects , wanting Deangelo to mimic his style . Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo , such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he can not hear himself think , but none are effective . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) see Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) sitting in her car eating a sandwich . She explains that she has begun eating lunch in her car to get some time away from Gabe Lewis ( Zach Woods ) , whom she is starting to despise . Pam advises Erin to tell Gabe her real feelings as soon as possible . This amuses Jim , given Pam \\'s history with Roy Anderson , and he leaves in order to avoid the temptation to comment on the irony . </P> <P> After work , the employees arrive at an Italian restaurant named Louie Volpe \\'s to celebrate the Dundies . Moments after being introduced , Deangelo disappears into the bathroom to vomit . Eventually , Michael is able to psych him up , and the show begins . The show continues to go poorly , with most of Michael \\'s jokes offending more than amusing the employees . Dwight wins the `` Promising Assistant Manager \\'\\' Dundie , but as he is still mad at Michael for not recommending he replace Michael , he tosses his award in the trash . Erin wins the `` Cutest Redhead \\'\\' award and gives a speech in which she breaks up with Gabe , who takes the stage to protest , then leaves in humiliation . Michael awards Deangelo with the `` Best Dundies Host \\'\\' award . The staff urges him to make a speech , but as he nervously tries to yell over his Walkman , the ceremony is kicked out of the restaurant . Michael is upset that his last Dundies Award show was a disappointment , but the staff convinces him to continue the event at the office . </P> <P> After Dwight , still angry with Michael , insults the Dundies and leaves , Michael and Deangelo continue the event in the conference room . After the last award , Andy leads the employees in serenading the soon - to - depart Michael with an altered version of the song `` Seasons of Love \\'\\' ; Michael is touched . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> `` Michael \\'s Last Dundies \\'\\' marked Will Ferrell \\'s second appearance on The Office . <P> `` Michael \\'s Last Dundies \\'\\' was written and directed by co-executive producer Mindy Kaling , the first time that she has both directed and written an episode of the series . Kaling was also the writer of the second season episode `` The Dundies \\'\\' , an episode to which `` Michael \\'s Last Dundies \\'\\' serves as a sequel in many ways . The episode was originally titled `` Goodbye , Michael Part 1 \\'\\' before NBC announced that `` Goodbye , Michael \\'\\' would be an extended 36 - minute episode and this episode was re-titled `` Michael \\'s Last Dundies \\'\\' . In the episode , a cue card features Dwight \\'s last name spelled incorrectly as `` Shrute \\'\\' . Kaling later admitted on Twitter that she had spelled the name that way `` in every script I \\'ve written since \\' Hot Girl \\' . \\'\\' </P> <P> The episode is the second of Will Ferrell \\'s four - episode guest stint on the series . Ferrell signed on to appear in Carell \\'s final three episodes , and the first episode without Carell , `` The Inner Circle \\'\\' , to make Carell \\'s transition easier . Ferrell initially called the producers and offered to appear in a few episodes in Carell \\'s last season , because he is `` a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell \\'s swan song \\'\\' . He had previously starred alongside Carell , in the 2004 film , Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy . </P> <P> The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Michael talking about his last Dundies using comedians as metaphors , Dwight booing Deangelo in order to adequately prepare him for his actual speech , various clips from the actual Dundies awards and of people accepting their awards , a cut scene featuring a video of Michael interviewing Danny Cordray ( Timothy Olyphant ) at his house , and Andy talking to Erin about loading the printer so that she can take her mind off of Gabe . </P> <H2> Cultural references ( edit ) </H2> <P> In this episode , Michael Scott describes the Dundies as `` like the Golden Globes but less mean \\'\\' referring to Ricky Gervais \\' hosting of the 2011 Golden Globe Awards ; which left critics questioning if he had gone `` too far \\'\\' . As executive producer of the American series and creator of the original British series , Gervais stated on his blog that the line was inserted as a metajoke was intended as `` a little in - joke \\'\\' . Near the beginning of the episode , Deangelo compares Meredith Palmer \\'s ( Kate Flannery ) house to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . Michael notes that `` When Larry King died , they did n\\'t just cancel his show \\'\\' , showing that Michael is unaware that Larry King is not deceased . Later , he notes that `` they got Piers Morgan to come in and do his show \\'\\' instead . The final song that the office sings to Michael is a parody of `` Seasons of Love \\'\\' from the Broadway musical Rent . Dwight later reveals in a talking head that he is always the padawan learner , and never a Jedi knight , a reference to the 1977 film Star Wars and its franchise . Michael notes that he wanted his last Dundies celebration to be like the 1990 film The Godfather Part III , rather than the `` confusing \\'\\' 1972 film The Godfather I , which he notes had `` three big laughs \\'\\' . Additionally , the episode contains several references to the film The King \\'s Speech , notably during the scene in which Deangelo gives his speech at the Dundies while listening to his Walkman played at a high volume . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> In its original American broadcast , `` Michael \\'s Last Dundies \\'\\' was viewed by an estimated 6.849 million households and received a 3.3 rating / 10 % share in the 18 -- 49 demographic . This means that it was seen by 3.3 % of all 18 - to 49 - year - olds , and 9 % of all 18 - to 49 - year - olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . This marked a significant drop in the ratings from the previous episode , `` Training Day \\'\\' . Despite this , the episode became the highest - rated NBC program for the original week it aired and also became the sixth-most - watched show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18 -- 49 . </P> \\' Michael \\'s Last Dundies \\' obviously wants to take on a particular meaning given that final song ( ... ) As a result , I think it is perfectly fair to hold the show accountable for the fact that the rest of it was built around a transparent set of bits being played by two actors , not two characters , and to wish that the big picture was more than just a musical afterthought in Carell \\'s next - to - last episode . <P> Myles McNutt , The A.V. Club </P> <P> The episode received a moderately positive review from Cindy White of IGN . She said `` the laughs were scarce this episode \\'\\' but the lack of humor was compensated by the `` emotional highlights \\'\\' . However , she praised the performances of many of the supporting cast . She ultimately gave the episode a 7 out of 10 , denoting a `` good \\'\\' episode . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that the episode was `` very up - and - down \\'\\' , largely due to inconsistent writing . He did , however , feel that the ending song was `` beautiful \\'\\' and `` enough to justify \\'\\' the episode . Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four - and - a-half stars out of five and called it `` funny and sweet \\'\\' and `` a perfect penultimate episode for Steve Carell \\'\\' . </P> <P> Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a `` B -- \\'\\' . He felt that it was appropriate that Steve Carell \\'s time on the series was bookended largely by the Dundies ; he noted that the episode in which the awards were introduced -- the eponymous second season entry -- served as `` a second pilot of sorts \\'\\' for the series , and the idea to bring the Dundies back made sense at the time in order to see how the characters had grown . However , he felt that the episode at large did not live up to its source material , and that it was `` occasionally funny but unfortunately meaningless \\'\\' . The ending song , however , in McNutt \\'s opinion , was a highlight of the episode . </P> <P> Will Ferrell \\'s character received criticism in the episode . White criticized Deangelo Vickers , noting that she did not have a handle on the character and that he was too `` downright normal \\'\\' and `` practically boring \\'\\' . McNutt argued that , while Ferrell `` is not really the problem with the role \\'\\' of Deangelo Vickers , the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like `` hanging out to commemorate the former \\'s departure from a television show \\'\\' rather than the two playing believable characters . He also felt that Deangelo `` feels disruptive to the show \\'s narrative \\'\\' because his character gets in the way of the plot . Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent `` so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do \\'\\' . He further noted that `` nobody has come up with a good reason for him being here other than that he \\'s Will Ferrell . \\'\\' </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Wilson , Rainn ( December 13 , 2012 ) . `` Remember all of these ? # FinalSeason \\'\\' .

In the address , Bryan supported bimetallism or `` free silver \\'\\' , which he believed would bring the nation prosperity . He decried the gold standard , concluding the speech , `` you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold \\'\\' . Bryan \\'s address helped catapult him to the Democratic Party \\'s presidential nomination ; it is considered one of the greatest political speeches in American history . </P> <P> For twenty years , Americans had been bitterly divided over the nation \\'s monetary standard . The gold standard , which the United States had effectively been on since 1873 , limited the money supply but eased trade with other nations , such as the United Kingdom , whose currency was also based on gold . Many Americans , however , believed that bimetallism ( making both gold and silver legal tender ) was necessary for the nation \\'s economic health . The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates , and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party , activists became determined to take over the Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver - supporting candidate in 1896 . </P> <P> Bryan had been a dark horse candidate with little support in the convention . His speech , delivered at the close of the debate on the party platform , electrified the convention and is generally credited with getting him the nomination for president . However , he lost the general election to William McKinley and the United States formally adopted the gold standard in 1900 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Background <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Monetary standards and the United States </Li> <Li> 1.2 Early attempts toward free silver </Li> <Li> 1.3 Bryan seeks the nomination </Li> <Li> 1.4 Selection of delegates </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 1896 convention <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Candidates for the nomination </Li> <Li> 2.2 Silver advocates take control </Li> <Li> 2.3 Bryan addresses the convention </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Reception and nomination <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Convention events </Li> <Li> 3.2 Press reaction </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Campaign and aftermath </Li> <Li> 5 Legacy </Li> <Li> 6 References <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Monetary standards and the United States ( edit ) </H3> <P> In January 1791 , at the request of Congress , Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton issued a report on the currency . At the time , there was no mint in the United States ; foreign coins were used . Hamilton proposed a monetary system based on bimetallism , in which the new currency would be equal to a given amount of gold , or a larger amount of silver ; at the time a given weight of gold was worth about 15 times as much as the same amount of silver . Although Hamilton understood that adjustment might be needed from time to time as precious metal prices fluctuated , he believed that if the nation \\'s unit of value were defined only by one of the two precious metals used for coins , the other would descend to the status of mere merchandise , unusable as a store of value . He also proposed the establishment of a mint , at which citizens could present gold or silver , and receive it back , struck into money . On April 2 , 1792 , Congress passed the Mint Act of 1792 . This legislation defined a unit of value for the new nation , to be known as a dollar . The new unit of currency was defined to be equal to 24.75 grains ( 1.604 g ) of gold , or alternatively , 371.25 grains ( 24.057 g ) of silver , establishing a ratio of value between gold and silver of 15 : 1 . The legislation also established the Mint of the United States . </P> <P> In the early 19th century , the economic disruption caused by the Napoleonic Wars caused United States gold coins to be worth more as bullion than as money , and they vanished from circulation . Governmental response to this shortage was hampered by the fact that officials did not clearly understand what had happened . In 1830 , Treasury Secretary Samuel D. Ingham proposed adjusting the ratio between gold and silver in US currency to 15.8 : 1 , which had for some time been the ratio in Europe . It was not until 1834 that Congress acted , changing the gold / silver ratio to 16.002 : 1 . This was close enough to the market value to make it uneconomic to export either US gold or silver coins . When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the California Gold Rush , silver coinage was worth more than face value , and rapidly flowed overseas for melting . Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative ( and future president ) Andrew Johnson , the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853 . Silver was now undervalued at the Mint ; accordingly little was presented for striking into money . </P> <P> The Coinage Act of 1873 eliminated the standard silver dollar . It also repealed the statutory provisions allowing silver bullion to be presented to the Mint and returned in the form of circulating money . In passing the Coinage Act , Congress eliminated bimetallism . During the economic chaos of the Panic of 1873 , the price of silver dropped significantly , but the Mint would accept none for striking into legal tender . Silver producers complained , and many Americans came to believe that only through bimetallism could the nation achieve and maintain prosperity . They called for the return to pre-1873 laws , which would require the Mint to take all the silver offered it and return it , struck into silver dollars . This would inflate the money supply , and , adherents argued , increase the nation \\'s prosperity . Critics contended that the inflation which would follow the introduction of such a policy would harm workers , whose wages would not rise as fast as prices would , and the operation of Gresham \\'s law would drive gold from circulation , effectively placing the United States on a silver standard . </P> <H3> Early attempts toward free silver ( edit ) </H3> Congressman Richard P. Bland <P> To advocates of what became known as free silver , the 1873 act became known as the `` Crime of \\' 73 \\'\\' . Pro-silver forces , with congressional leaders such as Missouri Representative Richard P. Bland , sought the passage of bills to allow depositors of silver bullion to receive it back in the form of coin . Such bills , sponsored by Bland , passed the House of Representatives in 1876 and 1877 , but both times failed in the Senate . A third attempt in early 1878 again passed the House , and eventually both houses after being amended in the Senate . The bill , as modified by amendments sponsored by Iowa Senator William B. Allison , did not reverse the 1873 provisions , but required the Treasury to purchase a minimum of $2 million of silver bullion per month ; the profit , or seignorage from monetizing the silver was to be used to purchase more silver bullion . The silver would be struck into dollar coins , to be circulated or else stored and used as backing for silver certificates . The Bland -- Allison Act was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes , but was enacted by Congress over his veto on February 28 , 1878 . </P> <P> Implementation of the Bland -- Allison Act did not end calls for free silver . The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other agricultural commodities . Silver advocates argued that this dropoff , which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production , was caused by the failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply , which had remained steady on a per capita basis . Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation . The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez - faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists , and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists . </P> <P> In 1890 , the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly increased government purchases of silver . The government pledged to stand behind the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold . Pursuant to this promise , government gold reserves dwindled over the following three years . Although the economic Panic of 1893 had a number of causes , President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman \\'s act to be a major factor , and called a special session of Congress to repeal it . Congress did so , but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions . Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold , with little effect but to increase the public debt , as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency . Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers , not the nation . The bankers \\' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currency -- the gold standard was deflationary , and as creditors , they preferred to be paid in such a currency , whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency . </P> <P> The effects of the depression which began in 1893 , and which continued through 1896 , ruined many Americans . Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25 % . The task of relieving the jobless fell to churches and other charities , as well as to labor unions . Farmers went bankrupt ; their farms were sold to pay their debts . Some of the impoverished died of disease or starvation ; others killed themselves . </P> <H3> Bryan seeks the nomination ( edit ) </H3> For additional detail on the political career of William Jennings Bryan before and during the 1896 campaign , see William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign , 1896 . <P> Among those who spoke against the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act was Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan . Known as an orator even then , Bryan had not always favored free silver out of conviction , stating in 1892 that he was for it because the people of Nebraska were for it . By 1893 , his views on silver had evolved , and on the floor of the House of Representatives , he delivered a riveting three - hour address against repeal of the Silver Purchase Act . In his conclusion , Bryan reached back in history : </P> <P> When a crisis like the present arose and the national bank of his day sought to control the politics of the nation , God raised up an Andrew Jackson , who had the courage to grapple with that great enemy , and by overthrowing it , he made himself the idol of the people and reinstated the Democratic party in public confidence . What will the decision be today ? The Democratic party has won the greatest success in its history . Standing upon this victory - crowned summit , will it turn its face to the rising or the setting sun ? Will it choose blessings or cursings -- life or death -- which ? Which ? </P> <P> Despite the repeal of the act , economic conditions failed to improve . The year 1894 saw considerable labor unrest . President Cleveland sent federal troops to Illinois to end the Pullman strike -- workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company , which made railroad cars , had struck after wages were cut . Railway employees had refused to handle Pullman cars in sympathy with the strikers ; this action threatened to paralyze the nation \\'s rail lines . The President \\'s move was opposed by the Democratic Governor of Illinois , John Altgeld . Angered by Cleveland \\'s actions in the labor dispute , and by his uncompromising stand against silver , Altgeld began to organize Democrats against Cleveland \\'s renomination in 1896 . Although Altgeld and his adherents urged voters to distinguish between Cleveland and his party , the Democrats lost 113 seats in the House in the 1894 midterm elections , the greatest loss by a majority party in congressional history . The Republicans gained control of the House , as well as the Senate , which until 1913 was elected by the state legislatures rather than by the popular vote . Among those defeated for Senate was Bryan in Nebraska . </P> <P> Bryan had long planned to run for president . Although he would only be 36 years old in 1896 -- one year above the constitutional minimum -- he believed the silver question could carry him not only to the nomination , but to the presidency . He traveled widely , speaking to audiences across the nation . His speeches impressed many ; even some of his opponents later conceded that Bryan was the most compelling speaker they had ever heard . Bryan \\'s speeches evolved over time ; in December 1894 , in a speech in Congress , he first used a phrase from which would come the conclusion to his most famous address : as originally stated , it was `` I will not help to crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . \\'\\' </P> <P> A myth has arisen that Bryan was an unknown prior to 1896 . This was not the case ; Bryan was well known as an orator on the tariff and silver questions . Albert Shaw , editor of The Review of Reviews , stated that after Bryan \\'s nomination , many easterners professed not to have heard of him but : `` If , indeed , they had not heard of Mr. Bryan before , they had failed to follow closely the course of American politics in the past eight years . As a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee through two Congresses , Mr. Bryan was by all odds the ablest and strongest orator on the Democratic side of the House . His subsequent canvass ( campaign ) for the United States senatorship in Nebraska was noteworthy and conspicuous on many accounts . \\'\\' </P> <P> In the aftermath of the 1894 election , the silver forces , led by Altgeld and others , began an attempt to take over the machinery of the Democratic Party . Historian Stanley Jones , in his study of the 1896 election , suggests that western Democrats would have opposed Cleveland even if the party had held its congressional majority in 1894 ; with the disastrous defeat , they believed the party would be wiped out in the West if it did not support silver . Bryan biographer Paulo E. Coletta wrote , `` during this year ( July 1894 -- June 1895 ) of calamities , disintegration and revolution , each crisis aided Bryan because it caused division within his party and permitted him to contest for its mastery as it slipped from Cleveland \\'s fingers . \\'\\' </P> <P> In early 1896 , with the economy still poor , there was widespread discontent with the two existing major political parties . Some people , for the most part Democrats , joined the far - left Populist Party . Many Republicans in the western states , dismayed by the strong allegiance of eastern Republicans to the gold standard , considered forming their own party . When the Republicans in June 1896 nominated former Ohio Governor William McKinley for president and passed at his request a platform strongly supporting `` sound money \\'\\' ( the gold standard unless modified by international agreement ) , a number of `` Silver Republicans \\'\\' walked out of the convention . The leader of those who left was Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller ; he was immediately spoken of as a possible candidate for the Democratic nomination . </P> <P> Bryan believed that he could , if nominated , unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign . However , part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention . He sent letters to national convention delegates , urging them to support silver , and enclosing copies of his photograph , writings , and speeches . Jones points out that though Bryan \\'s speaking engagements were not deemed political by the standards of 1896 , by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better - known candidates . </P> <P> Historian James A. Barnes , in his historical journal article pointing out myths that have arisen about Bryan \\'s candidacy and campaign , stated that Bryan \\'s efforts bore fruit even before the convention : </P> <P> By April , 1896 , many individuals were quietly working for Bryan \\'s nomination . Circulars were being distributed in Illinois , and admirers in Nebraska , North Carolina , Mississippi , Louisiana , Texas , Arkansas , and other states were urging his selection among their friends . It was not in any concerted or open action , however , that Bryan had his strength ; it was in the friendly predisposition of the mass of the delegates that he had hopes . </P> <H3> Selection of delegates ( edit ) </H3> <P> The 1896 Democratic National Convention followed events unique in post-Civil War American history . One after another , state conventions to elect delegates to the national convention in Chicago repudiated an incumbent elected president of their party , who had not declared whether he would be a candidate for renomination . According to Barnes : </P> <P> The people of the South and the West had for years been convinced of the enormity of the `` crime of 1873 \\'\\' , and they had long since come to regard silver as the sword that would cut the Gordian knot of privilege . Consciousness of grievances of years and not of months was reflected in the decisive action of the state Democratic conventions in the spring and early summer of 1896 . </P> <P> Many state conventions elected delegates pledged to support bimetallism in the party platform . Gold Democrats were successful in a few states in the Northeast , but had little luck elsewhere . Speakers in some states cursed Cleveland ; the South Carolina convention denounced him . Cleveland issued a statement urging Democratic voters to support gold -- the next convention to be held , in Illinois , unanimously supported silver ; the keynote speaker prayed for divine forgiveness for Cleveland \\'s 1892 nomination . Gold and silver factions in some states , such as Bryan \\'s Nebraska , sent rival delegations to the convention . </P> <H2> 1896 convention ( edit ) </H2> For a fuller explanation of the procedures of American political conventions , see United States presidential nominating convention . The Chicago Coliseum <P> The 1896 Democratic convention opened at the Chicago Coliseum on July 7 , 1896 . Much activity took place in advance of the formal opening as the silver and ( vastly outnumbered ) gold forces prepared their strategies . Silver forces were supported by the Democratic National Bimetallic Committee , the umbrella group formed in 1895 to support silver Democrats in their insurgency against Cleveland . Gold Democrats looked to the President for leadership , but Cleveland , trusting few in his party , did not involve himself further in the gold efforts , but spent the week of the convention fishing off the New Jersey coast . </P> <P> The Bimetallic Committee carefully planned to take control of every aspect of the convention , eliminating any threat that the minority gold faction could take power . It made no secret of these preparations . This takeover was considered far more important than was the choice of presidential candidate , and the committee decided to take no position on who should win the race for the nomination , reasoning that the victor , no matter who he was , would be a silver man . Well aware of the overwhelming forces against them , many gold delegates were inclined to concede the platform battle . </P> <P> Bryan arrived quietly and took rooms at a modest hotel ; the Nebraskan later calculated that he spent less than $100 while in Chicago . He arrived convinced that he would win the nomination . He had already begun work on a speech . On the evening of July 5 , Bryan was visited by a delegation of Coloradans , seeking his support for Senator Teller . They went away apologetically , not having known Bryan sought the nomination . </P> <H3> Candidates for the nomination ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite the desire of silver delegates to nominate a candidate who shared their beliefs , and although several states instructed their delegates to vote for a specific candidate , there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention . With a two - thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate , almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success , though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate \\'s chances . </P> Former Iowa Governor Horace Boies was a major contender for the Democratic nomination for president in 1896 . <P> The only gold man who put together any sort of campaign for the Democratic nomination was Treasury Secretary John G. Carlisle , but he withdrew in April , stating that he was more concerned about the platform of the party than who would lead it . However , as late as June , the gold forces , which still controlled the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) , continued to believe that the nominee could be pro-gold . Cleveland friend and former Postmaster General Donald M. Dickinson wrote to the President in June 1896 hoping that the delegates would recognize `` common sense \\'\\' and be frightened at the thought of nominating a radical . </P> <P> One of the leaders of the silver movement was Illinois Governor Altgeld ; a native of Germany , he was constitutionally barred from the presidency by his foreign birth . Going into the convention , the two leading candidates for the nomination were former Congressman Bland , who had originated the Bland - Allison Act , and former Iowa Governor Horace Boies , with Bland considered the frontrunner . These were the only two candidates to put together organizations to try to secure delegate votes , though both efforts were cash - starved . Both men had electoral problems : Bland at age 61 was seen by some as a man whose time had passed ; Boies was a former Republican who had once decried bimetallism . There were a large number of potential candidates seen as having less support ; these included Vice President Adlai Stevenson of Illinois , Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky , Senator Teller , and Bryan . </P> <H3> Silver advocates take control ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although Bryan had decided on a strategy to gain the nomination -- to give a speech which would make him the logical candidate in the eyes of delegates -- he faced obstacles along the way . For one thing , he began the 1896 convention without any official status -- the Democratic National Committee , which made the initial determination of which delegations would be seated , had chosen the pro-gold Nebraskans to represent their state . Bryan had been waiting outside the committee room when his rivals were seated by a 27 -- 23 vote ; contemporary accounts state he was `` somewhat surprised \\'\\' at the result . The DNC \\'s action could be reversed , but not until the convention \\'s credentials committee reported . However , Barnes deemed the actions by the committee immaterial to the outcome due to the silver strength in the convention : </P> <P> Anyone who doubts the power the silverites were ready to unleash in a disciplined and irresistible attack needs only to read the results of the election of temporary chairman . The gold men , though they possessed the machinery of the party , had neither the power nor the strength to challenge their opponents . They could only beg them to spare the party the humiliation of broken traditions and the overthrowing of established control . Nevertheless , Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia was by an overwhelming vote elected temporary chairman , and a Committee on Credentials was appointed that seated Bryan and his contesting Nebraska delegation . </P> We demand the free and unlimited coinage of both silver and gold at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1 without waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation . We demand that the standard silver dollar shall be a full legal tender , equally with gold , for all debts , public and private , and we favor such legislation as will prevent for the future the demonitization of any kind of legal tender by private contract . <P> From the money plank of the Democratic platform </P> <P> Good luck favored Bryan -- he was considered for various convention roles by the silverites , but each time was not selected . The temporary chairmanship , for example , would have permitted him to deliver the keynote address . However , Bryan , lacking a seat at the start of the convention , could not be elected temporary chairman . Bryan considered this no loss at all ; the focus of the convention was on the party platform and the debate which would precede its adoption . The platform would symbolize the repudiation of Cleveland and his policies after the insurgents \\' long struggle , and Bryan was determined to close the debate on the platform . Bryan , once seated , was Nebraska \\'s representative to the Committee on Resolutions ( generally called the `` platform committee \\'\\' ) , which allocated 80 minutes to each side in the debate and selected Bryan as one of the speakers . South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman was to be the other pro-silver speaker , and originally wished to close the debate . However , the senator wanted 50 minutes to speak , too long for a closing address , and at Bryan \\'s request agreed to open the debate instead . Accordingly , Bryan became the final speaker on the platform . </P> <P> Delegates , as they waited for the committees to complete their work , spent much of the first two days listening to various orators . Of these , only Senator Blackburn , a silver supporter , sparked much reaction , and that only momentary . Delegates called for better - known speakers , such as Altgeld or Bryan , but were granted neither then ; the Illinois governor declined , and the Nebraskan , once seated , spent much of his time away from the convention floor at the platform committee meeting at the Palmer House . </P> <P> The debate on the platform opened at the start of the third day of the convention , July 9 , 1896 . The session was supposed to begin at 10 : 00 a.m. , but as delegates , slowed by the long commute from the hotels to the Coliseum and fatigue from the first two days , did not arrive on time , proceedings did not begin until 10 : 45 . Nevertheless , large crowds gathered outside the public entrances ; the galleries were quickly packed . Once the convention came to order , Arkansas Senator James K. Jones , chair of the Committee on Resolutions , read the proposed platform to cheers by many delegates ; the reading of the pro-gold minority report attracted less applause . </P> In a 1900 engraving , former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell is shown preceding Bryan in addressing the convention . <P> `` Pitchfork Ben \\'\\' Tillman lived up to his nickname with an incendiary address which began with a reference to his home state \\'s role in beginning the Civil War . Although Tillman endorsed silver , his address was so laced with sectionalism that most silver delegates remained silent for fear of being seen as supporting him . Tillman \\'s speech , scheduled to be the only one in support of silver except Bryan \\'s , was so badly received that Senator Jones , who had not planned to speak , gave a brief address asserting that silver was a national issue . </P> <P> Senator David B. Hill of New York , a gold supporter , was next . As Hill moved to the podium , a reporter friend passed Bryan a note urging him to make a patriotic speech without hint of sectionalism ; Bryan responded , `` You will not be disappointed . \\'\\' Hill gave a calm speech defending the gold position , and swayed few delegates . He was followed by two other gold men , Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell . Vilas gave a lengthy defense of the Cleveland administration \\'s policies , so long that Russell , fearing that Vilas \\' speech would cut into his time , asked that the time given to the gold proponents be extended by ten minutes . Bryan consented , on condition that his own time was extended by the same amount ; this was agreed to . `` And I needed it for the speech I was to make . \\'\\' Bryan later wrote , `` This was another unexpected bit of good fortune . I had never had such an opportunity before in my life and never expect to have again . \\'\\' </P> <P> Vilas quickly lost his audience , which did not want to hear Cleveland defended . Russell \\'s address was inaudible to most of the Coliseum ; he was ill and died just over a week later . As the gold men spoke , Bryan ate a sandwich to settle his stomach ; he was often nervous before major speeches . Another reporter approached him and asked him who he thought would win the nomination . `` Strictly confidential , not to be quoted for publication : I will be . \\'\\' </P> <H3> Bryan addresses the convention ( edit ) </H3> <P> As Russell concluded , to strong applause from gold delegates , there was a buzz of anticipation as Bryan ascended to the podium . There was loud cheering as Bryan stood there , waiting for his audience to calm . Bryan \\'s lecture tours had left him a well - known spokesman for silver . As yet , no one at the convention had effectively spoken for that cause , which was paramount to the delegates . According to political scientist Richard F. Bensel in his study of the 1896 Democratic convention , `` Although the silver men knew they would win this fight , they nonetheless needed someone to tell them -- and the gold men -- why they must enshrine silver at the heart of the platform . \\'\\' Bensel noted , `` The pump was more than primed , it was ready to explode . \\'\\' Bryan would say little that he had not said before -- the text is similar to that of a speech he had given the previous week at Crete , Nebraska -- but he would give the convention its voice . </P> The 1896 Democratic National Convention <P> Bryan began softly , </P> <P> I would be presumptuous , indeed , to present myself against the distinguished gentlemen to whom you have listened if this were a mere measuring of abilities ; but this is not a contest between persons . The humblest citizen in all the land , when clad in the armor of a righteous cause , is stronger than all the hosts of error . I come to speak to you in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty -- the cause of humanity . </P> <P> Bryan \\'s opening claimed no personal prestige for himself -- but nevertheless placed him as the spokesman for silver . According to Bensel , the self - deprecation helped disarm the delegates . As Bryan was not deemed a major contender for the nomination , even delegates committed to a candidate could cheer him without seeming to betray their allegiance . Bryan then recounted the history of the silver movement ; the audience , which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his opening statements , quieted . Throughout the speech , Bryan had the delegates in the palm of his hand ; they cheered on cue . The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir . As he concluded his historical recitation , he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory , `` not to discuss , not to debate , but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country \\'\\' . </P> <P> Bryan continued with language evoking the Civil War , telling his audience that `` in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother , father against son . \\'\\' By then , as he spoke in a sincere tone , his voice sounded clearly and loudly through the hall . He denied , however that the contest was personal ; he bore no ill - will towards those who supported the gold standard . However , he stated , facing towards the gold delegates , `` when you come before us and tell us that we are about to disturb your business interests , we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course . \\'\\' The gold men , during the address , paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan \\'s oratory . Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men , who were associated with financial interests , especially in the East . Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell , Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening , and had not used it in earlier speeches . He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech , and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners : </P> <P> We say to you that you have made the definition of a business man too limited in its application . The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer ; the attorney in a country town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis ; the merchant at the cross-roads store is as much a business man as the merchant of New York ; the farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day , who begins in spring and toils all summer , and who by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of the country creates wealth , is as much a business man as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain ; the miners who go down a thousand feet into the earth , or climb two thousand feet upon the cliffs , and bring forth from their hiding places the precious metals to be poured into the channels of trade are as much business men as the few financial magnates who , in a back room , corner the money of the world . We come to speak of this broader class of business men . </P> <P> Through this passage , Bryan maintained the contrast between the common man and the city - dwelling elite . It was clear to listeners as he worked his way through the comparisons that he would refer to the farmer , and when he did , the hall exploded with sound . His sympathetic comparison contrasted the hardworking farmer with the city businessman , whom Bryan cast as a gambler . The galleries were filled with white as spectators waved handkerchiefs , and it was several minutes before he could continue . The police in the convention hall , not sharing the enthusiasm for silver , were described by the press ( some of whose members were caught up in the frenzy ) as standing as if they thought the audience was about to turn on them . When Bryan resumed , his comparison of miner with miser again electrified the audience ; the uproar prevented him from continuing for several minutes . One farmer in the gallery had been about to leave rather than listen to Bryan , whom he deemed a Populist ; he had been persuaded to stay . At Bryan \\'s words , he threw his hat into the air , slapped the empty seat in front of him with his coat , and shouted , `` My God ! My God ! My God ! \\'\\' </P> <P> Bryan , having established the right of silver supporters to petition , explained why that petition was not to be denied : </P> <P> It is for these that we speak . We do not come as aggressors . Our war is not a war of conquest ; we are fighting in the defense of our homes , our families , and posterity . We have petitioned , and our petitions have been scorned ; we have entreated , and our entreaties have been disregarded ; we have begged , and they have mocked when our calamity came . We beg no longer ; we entreat no more ; we petition no more . We defy them ! </P> <P> With this call to action , Bryan abandoned any hint at compromise , and adopted the techniques of the radical , polarizing orator , finding no common ground between silver and gold forces . He then defended the remainder of the platform , though only speaking in general terms . He mocked McKinley , said by some to resemble Napoleon , noting that he was nominated on the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo . The lengthy passage as he discussed the platform and the Republicans helped calm the audience , ensuring he would be heard as he reached his peroration . But Bryan first wished to tie the silver question to a greater cause : </P> <P> Upon which side will the Democratic Party fight ; upon the side of `` the idle holders of idle capital \\'\\' or upon the side of `` the struggling masses \\'\\' ? That is the question which the party must answer first , and then it must be answered by each individual hereafter . The sympathies of the Democratic Party , as shown by the platform , are on the side of the struggling masses , who have ever been the foundation of the Democratic Party . </P> <P> He faced in the direction of the gold - dominated state delegations : </P> <P> There are two ideas of government . There are those who believe that , if you will only legislate to make the well - to - do prosperous , their prosperity will leak through on those below . The Democratic idea , however , has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous , their prosperity will find its way up through every class which rests upon them . You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard ; we reply that the great cities rest upon our broad and fertile prairies . Burn down your cities and leave our farms , and your cities will spring up again as if by magic ; but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country . </P> <P> This statement attracted great cheering , and Bryan turned to rhetorically demolish the compromise position on bimetallism -- that it should only be accomplished through international agreement : </P> <P> It is the issue of 1776 over again . Our ancestors , when but three millions in number , had the courage to declare their political independence of every other nation ; shall we , their descendants , when we have grown to seventy millions , declare that we are less independent than our forefathers ? No , my friends , that will never be the verdict of our people . Therefore , we care not upon what lines the battle is fought . If they say bimetallism is good , but that we can not have it until other nations help us , we reply that , instead of having a gold standard because England has , we will restore bimetallism , and then let England have bimetallism because the United States has it . If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing , we will fight them to the uttermost . </P> <P> Now , Bryan was ready to conclude the speech , and according to his biographer , Michael Kazin , step `` into the headlines of American history \\'\\' . </P> <P> Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world , supported by the commercial interests , the laboring interests , and the toilers everywhere , we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them : `` You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns ; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . \\'\\' </P> <P> As Bryan spoke his final sentence , recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus , he placed his hands to his temples , fingers extended ; with the final words , he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause , as the audience watched in dead silence . He then lowered them , descended from the podium , and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held . </P> <H2> Reception and nomination ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Convention events ( edit ) </H3> <P> Bryan later described the silence as `` really painful \\'\\' and momentarily thought he had failed . As he moved towards his seat , the Coliseum burst into pandemonium . Delegates threw hats , coats , and handkerchiefs into the air . Others took up the standards with the state names on them with each delegation , and planted them by Nebraska \\'s . Two alert police officers had joined Bryan as he left the podium , anticipating the crush . The policemen were swept away by the flood of delegates , who raised Bryan to their shoulders and carried him around the floor . The Washington Post newspaper recorded , `` bedlam broke loose , delirium reigned supreme . \\'\\' </P> <P> It took about 25 minutes to restore order , and according to Bensel , `` somewhere in the mass demonstration that was convulsing the convention hall , the transfer of sentiment from silver as a policy to Bryan as a presidential candidate took place \\'\\' . Newspaper accounts of the convention leave little doubt but that , had a vote been taken at that moment ( as many were shouting to do ) , Bryan would have been nominated . Bryan was urged by Senator Jones to allow it , but refused , stating that if his boom would not last overnight , it would never last until November . He soon retired from the convention , returning to his hotel to await the outcome . The convention passed the platform in Bryan \\'s absence and recessed . </P> <P> The balloting began the following morning , July 10 , with a two - thirds vote necessary to nominate . Bryan , who remained at his hotel , sent word to the Nebraska delegation to make no deals on his behalf . He stood second out of fourteen candidates in the first ballot , behind Bland . On the second ballot , Bryan still stood second , but had gained as other candidates had fallen away . The third ballot saw Bland still in the lead , but Bryan took the lead on the fourth ballot . According to Jones , it was clear that Bland could not win , and that Bryan could not be stopped . On the fifth ballot , the Illinois delegation , led by Governor Altgeld , switched its votes from Bland to Bryan . Other delegations , seeing that Bryan would be nominated , also switched , securing the victory . Nevertheless , he won the nomination without the votes of the gold delegates , most of whom either left the convention or refused to vote . </P> <H3> Press reaction ( edit ) </H3> Judge magazine criticized Bryan for sacrilege in his speech . He is shown with crown and cross , but trampling the Bible . <P> Most contemporary press accounts attributed Bryan \\'s nomination to his eloquence , though in the case of Republican and other gold - favoring newspapers , they considered it his demagoguery . The pro-silver Cleveland Plain Dealer called Bryan \\'s speech `` an eloquent , stirring , and manly appeal \\'\\' . The Chicago Tribune reported that Bryan had lit the spark `` which touched off the trail of gun - powder \\'\\' . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined that with the speech , Bryan `` just about immortalized himself \\'\\' . </P> <P> According to the New York World , `` Lunacy having dictated the platform , it was perhaps natural that hysteria should evolve the candidate . \\'\\' The New York Times disparaged Bryan as `` the gifted blatherskite from Nebraska \\'\\' . The only paper to predict , after Bryan gave his speech , that he would not be nominated was The Wall Street Journal , which stated , `` Bryan has had his day \\'\\' . The Akron Journal and Republican , no friend to Bryan , opined that `` never probably has a national convention been swayed or influenced by a single speech as was the national Democratic convention \\'\\' . </P> <H2> Campaign and aftermath ( edit ) </H2> Main article : William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign , 1896 § General election campaign <P> The Pullman Company offered Bryan a private car for his trip home ; he declined , not wishing to accept corporate favors . As he traveled by rail to Lincoln , he saw farmers and others standing by the tracks , hoping for a glimpse of the new Democratic nominee . He received many letters from supporters , expressing their faith in him in stark terms . One Indiana voter wrote , `` God has sent you amongst our people to save the poor from starvation , and we no ( sic ) you will save us . \\'\\' A farmer in Iowa , in a letter to Bryan , stated , `` You are the first big man that i ( sic ) ever wrote to . \\'\\' </P> Bryan campaigning on stage a few months after the speech <P> When McKinley heard that Bryan was likely to be the nominee , he called the report `` rot \\'\\' and hung up the phone . The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination , stating his view that the silver sentiment would be gone in a month . When McKinley and his advisers , such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna , realized that the views were more than transitory , they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy . The money went for speakers , pamphlets , and other means of conveying their `` sound money \\'\\' campaign to the voter . With far less money than McKinley , Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then - unprecedented scale . McKinley on the other hand , opted for a front porch campaign . Both men spoke to hundreds of thousands of people from their chosen venues . </P> <P> Bryan \\'s nomination divided the party . The dissidents nominated their own ticket ; the split in the vote would contribute to Bryan \\'s defeat . However , Bryan did gain the support of the Populists , as well as a convention of Silver Republicans . Bryan spoke on silver throughout the campaign ; he rarely addressed other issues . Bryan won the South and most of the West , but McKinley \\'s victories in the more populous Northeast and Midwest carried him to the presidency . The Democratic candidate failed to gain a majority of the labor vote ; McKinley won in working - class areas as well as wealthy precincts . Although McKinley outpolled him by 600,000 votes , Bryan received more votes than any previous presidential candidate . </P> <P> After McKinley \\'s inauguration , increases in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods led to a considerable increase in the money supply . Even so , in 1900 , Congress passed the Gold Standard Act , formally placing the United States on that standard . Although Bryan ran again on a silver platform in the 1900 presidential election , the issue failed to produce the same resonance with the voters . McKinley won more easily than in 1896 , making inroads in the silver West . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> A `` Bryan dollar \\'\\' issued by his opponents to illustrate the difference between the size of a silver dollar and the amount of bullion that could be purchased with a dollar . <P> Bryan \\'s speech is considered one of the most powerful political addresses in American history . Stanley Jones , however , suggested that even if Bryan had never delivered it , he would still have been nominated . Jones deemed the Democrats likely to nominate a candidate who would appeal to the Populist Party , and Bryan had been elected to Congress with Populist support . According to rhetorical historian William Harpine in his study of the rhetoric of the 1896 campaign , `` Bryan \\'s speech cast a net for the true believers , but only for the true believers . \\'\\' Harpine suggested that , `` by appealing in such an uncompromising way to the agrarian elements and to the West , Bryan neglected the national audience who would vote in the November election \\'\\' . Bryan \\'s emphasis on agrarian issues , both in his speech and in his candidacy , may have helped cement voting patterns which kept the Democrats largely out of power until the 1930s . </P> <P> Writer Edgar Lee Masters called the speech , `` the beginning of a changed America . \\'\\' Bryan \\'s words gave rise to later economic and political philosophies , including Huey Long \\'s 1930s Share Our Wealth program , with its trigger phrase , `` Every Man a King \\'\\' inspired by Bryan \\'s speech . Author and political commentator William Safire , in his political dictionary , traced the term `` trickle - down economics \\'\\' ( common in the Reagan era ) to Bryan \\'s statement that some believe that government should legislate for the wealthy , and allow prosperity to `` leak through \\'\\' on those below . Historian R. Hal Williams suggested that the opposite philosophy , of legislation for the masses leading to prosperity for all , advocated by Bryan in his speech , informed the domestic policies of later Democratic presidents , including Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal . </P> <P> Bensel ties the delegates \\' response to Bryan \\'s address to their uncertainty in their own beliefs : </P> <P> In a very real sense , adoption of the silver plank in the platform was akin to a millennial expectation that the `` laws of economics \\'\\' would henceforth be suspended and that the silver men could simply `` will \\'\\' that silver and gold would , in fact , trade on financial markets at a ratio of sixteen to one . The silver men were thus in the hunt for a charismatic leader who would underpin what they already desperately wanted to believe . They manufactured that leader in the convention , a fabrication in which Bryan was only too happy to assist . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Kazin , p. 61 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Taxay , pp. 48 -- 49 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Coin World Almanac , p. 455 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Lange , pp. 42 -- 43 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Taxay , p. 193 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Taxay , pp. 217 -- 221 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Jones , p. 7 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Coin World Almanac , p. 456 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , pp. 7 -- 13 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Taxay , pp. 261 -- 267 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , pp. 7 -- 9 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 25 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , pp. 43 -- 45 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 28 -- 29 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 67 -- 68 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Cherny , pp. 52 -- 53 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kazin , pp. 38 -- 40 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , p. 68 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 41 -- 45 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kazin , pp. 41 -- 43 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kazin , pp. 42 -- 44 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 67 -- 71 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kazin , pp. 46 -- 48 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Barnes , p. 380 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , p. 49 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Coletta , p. 100 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Kazin , p. 52 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , p. 74 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , pp. 184 -- 185 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Barnes , p. 381 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Barnes , p. 374 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 72 -- 74 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 22 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , pp. 192 -- 193 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , pp. 216 -- 217 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 32 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , p. 225 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Harpine , pp. 48 -- 49 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Coletta , p. 124 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , pp. 301 -- 302 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , p. 72 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , p. 69 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 70 -- 73 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Cherny , p. 56 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 57 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Cherny , p. 59 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Barnes , p. 376 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Official Proceedings of the 1896 Democratic National Convention , p. 254 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 80 -- 81 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Bensel , pp. 206 -- 209 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , pp. 128 -- 129 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , p. 81 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , pp. 210 -- 213 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Jones , p. 226 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 81 -- 82 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Williams , p. 82 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Bensel , p. 223 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , pp. 82 -- 83 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Jones , p. 227 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , pp. 223 -- 224 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 245 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , p. 83 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Jones , p. 229 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Bensel , pp. 224 -- 225 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , pp. 237 -- 238 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Williams , p. 84 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Harpine , p. 49 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kazin , p. 60 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Coletta , p. 138 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Jones , p. 228 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Williams , pp. 84 -- 85 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 233 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Coletta , p. 139 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 227 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Harpine , pp. 51 -- 52 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Bensel , pp. 230 -- 232 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Official Proceedings of the 1896 Democratic National Convention , p. 233 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 232 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Williams , p. 86 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , pp. 232 -- 234 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Bensel , p. 236 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 237 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , pp. 241 -- 242 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kazin , p. 62 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , p. 87 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , pp. 234 -- 236 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Harpine , p. 52 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 242 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , p. 88 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Harpine , p. 53 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Williams , p. 91 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Williams , p. 93 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , p. 301 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Cherny , pp. 64 -- 66 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , p. 241 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , pp. 244 -- 255 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Williams , p. 152 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Cherny , p. 70 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Phillips , pp. 114 -- 115 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Harpine , p. 1 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , p. 239 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Harpine , p. 55 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Woods , pp. 9 -- 10 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jones , p. 346 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Safire , p. 225 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Safire , pp. 752 -- 753 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Williams , p. 161 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bensel , pp. 310 -- 311 . </Li> </Ol> <H3> Bibliography ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Barnes , James A.

Meanwhile , Manny and Ellie are preparing upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fiancé , Julian . Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family , but their fierce appearance tends to scare kids . Sid is dumped by his girlfriend , Francine , just as he is about to propose to her , and he laments his solitude . During Manny and Ellie \\'s wedding anniversary party , some of the asteroids strike the place and The Herd barely escape . Meanwhile , at the underground lost world , Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen by a trio of flying dromaeosaurs named Gavin , Gertie , and Roger . Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface , where he meets Manny and the others . </P> <P> Buck explains to The Herd that according to the pillar , the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming , he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones , as according to its engravings , they always fall at the same place . However , the three dromaeosaurs overhear their conversation , and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them , believing that they could easily avoid the impact , thus not only getting their revenge on Buck , but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species . Roger is reluctant , but Gavin and Gertie strong - arm him into cooperating . </P> <P> As The Herd travels to the crash site , they discover that the asteroids have electro - magnetic properties . Buck theorizes that if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit , they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth . After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs , The Herd arrives at `` Geotopia \\'\\' , a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago , where Sid meets Brooke , a female ground sloth who falls in love with him . However , Shangri Llama , the leader of Geotopia , refuses to cooperate with Buck \\'s plan to send the city \\'s crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact , as they are the key to the residents \\' longevity . Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with , immediately aging them to their real ages and revealing their true crone - like appearances . </P> <P> Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid \\'s fall is more important than their lost youth , they and The Herd help with Buck \\'s plan , which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away . The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene , but Buck convinces Roger that they will not be able to survive the asteroid , and he in turn convinces Gavin and Gertie to help . The plan works , and the asteroid is pulled back into space . The Herd then departs back home , including Sid , who parts ways from Brooke , but just after they leave , an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring , giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid \\'s grandmother , who stayed behind with them , regain their youth . After The Herd returns , Manny reconciles with Julian , Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding , Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before , and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid . </P> <P> In the film \\'s epilogue , Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on Mars , destroying all life on the planet . </P> <P> In a mid-credits scene , Scrat finds his acorn , but gets beaten by some doors . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Ice Age characters <Ul> <Li> Ray Romano as Manny , a woolly mammoth and the leader of The Herd . </Li> <Li> John Leguizamo as Sid , a ground sloth and the founder of The Herd . </Li> <Li> Denis Leary as Diego , a saber - toothed tiger and the member of The Herd . </Li> <Li> Queen Latifah as Ellie , a female woolly mammoth -- Manny \\'s wife . </Li> <Li> Simon Pegg as Buck , a one - eyed weasel and a dinosaur - hunter who reunites with The Herd to warn them of the coming asteroid .

As with the third film , which was also inspired by the ice cave scene in which The Herd comes across a dinosaur that was incased in ice , the team went back to the first film to search for a possible inspiration for this next installment . The characters were first hand - drawn on animation software , complete with color and animated clips of the characters doing specific actions . They were then sent to be hand - sculpted with clay , and ultimately scanned into CGI software and animated around the model . </P> <P> The `` Figaro \\'s Aria \\'\\' sequence which involved Buck saving an egg from a trio of dromaeosaurs proved to be one of the most challenging sequences for Blue Sky Studios \\' animators , as it involved a continuous uninterrupted shot that ran for around two minutes long . It was one of the first scenes put into production but also one of the last to exit production due to its time - consuming and difficult structure , as the team would only be able to produce three or four seconds of footage a week . </P> <P> The recording session took place in Los Angeles , California since most of the actors live there while the studio is based in New York City . Director Mike Thurmeier and co-director Galen T. Chu would take turns travelling to L.A. to head the recording sessions . In the film , Simon Pegg sang a rendition of `` Figaro \\'\\' . Jesse Tyler Ferguson was offered the role after the producers saw his performance in Modern Family . It is his first time working in an animated film . Ferguson blew out his voice on the first day of the recording session because he did a lot of yelling . He then took a few days off and came back later to finish his part . He admitted that he struggled the first time he heard his voice come out of his character \\'s mouth . As a result , he decided to stop watching interviews of himself on television because he found them to be `` too weird \\'\\' . </P> <P> A promotional poster , shown in June 2015 , at the Licensing Expo , revealed the film \\'s full title : Ice Age : Collision Course . </P> <H2> Soundtrack ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Ice Age : Collision Course </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Film score by John Debney </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Released </Th> <Td> July 19 , 2016 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Recorded </Th> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Genre </Th> <Td> Score </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Label </Th> <Td> Varèse Sarabande </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Producer </Th> <Td> John Debney </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> John Debney film scores chronology </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Mother \\'s Day ( 2016 ) </Td> <Td> Ice Age : Collision Course ( 2016 ) </Td> <Td> League of Gods ( 2016 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The film was composed by John Debney , who replaced John Powell from the previous three films due to Powell being busy with other projects .

However , the release was delayed to July 22 , to avoid competition with the Ghostbusters reboot that was also scheduled for July 15 . An extended sneak peek of the movie in the form of a short film called Cosmic Scrat - tastrophe was attached to theatrical showings of Blue Sky Studio \\'s The Peanuts Movie on November 6 , 2015 . The teaser poster of the film was revealed on November 6 , 2015 with the words `` Bring Scrat Home \\'\\' spoofing The Martian . The short film was released later on November 9 , 2015 , on 20th Century Fox \\'s official YouTube page . </P> <H3> Home media ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ice Age : Collision Course was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on DVD , Blu - ray , Blu - ray 3D , 4K Blu - ray and digital download on October 11 , 2016 . Special features include a new short film titled Scrat : Spaced Out , which is primarily made up of Scrat \\'s scenes from the film , with a few unique scenes at the end . </P> <H3> Cosmic Scrat - tastrophe ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cosmic Scrat - tastrophe is a five - minute short film , with the majority of its footage , minus the closing scene , taken from the beginning of Ice Age : Collision Course . Directed by Michael Thurmeier and Galen Chu , the short premiered on November 6 , 2015 , along with the film The Peanuts Movie . In the short , Scrat , trying to bury his acorn , accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space , where he unwittingly sends several asteroids en route to a collision with Earth . </P> <H3> Scrat : Spaced out ( edit ) </H3> <P> Scrat : Spaced Out is a 15 - minute short film that compiles all Scrat \\'s scenes from Ice Age : Collision Course with a few unique scenes at the end . The short was included on the film \\'s home media releases . </P> <P> Following the events of Ice Age : Collision Course , Scrat is heading back to Earth in the saucer . An acorn - shaped ship appears and pulls the acorn , with Scrat holding onto it . In the ship , three alien squirrels ( A.K.A Scratzons ) are surprised by finding Scrat , and blast him away from the acorn . Scrat tries to take it back with a tractor beam in a nearby saucer , but the alien leader pulls it back with another tractor beam . Being pulled to both sides , the nutrogen inside the acorn snaps , creating a massive explosion , which destroys the ship and creates a black hole sucking everything nearby into it . Scrat jumps out of the saucer , knocks the Scratzon alien leader into the black hole while trying to save the acorn , but gets pulled in the hole nonetheless . He emerges in space along with the acorn , only for the black hole appearing again , snatching the acorn and leaving Scrat alone again . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ice Age : Collision Course grossed $64 million in North America and $344 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $408 million , against a budget of $105 million .

In its second weekend , it added $32.2 million from 25 countries . As a result , it only topped the international box office for a non-Chinese film but also helped Fox pass the $2 billion mark internationally , making this the eighth consecutive calendar year Fox has surpassed this milestone , and the 10th time in the studio \\'s history . The film came in third place overall , behind the two Chinese films Cold War 2 and Big Fish & Begonia . By its third weekend , after grossing another $53.5 million from 15,132 screens in a total 51 markets , it finally topped the international box office and became the biggest grosser of the weekend . </P> <P> It recorded the biggest opening of all time for Fox in Argentina ( $3.77 million ) , where its debut is also the third - biggest of all time behind Furious 7 and Captain America : Civil War ; Colombia ( $2.18 million ) , Central America ( $2.2 million ) , and Uruguay ( $620,618 ) ; the second - biggest in Mexico ( $8.4 million ) , behind Ice Age : Continental Drift ; Peru , Chile , and Ecuador ; the biggest opening among the series in Brazil ( $4.5 million ) and the biggest non-holiday animated opening ever in India ( $1.66 million ) .

The site \\'s critical consensus reads , `` Unoriginal and unfunny , Ice Age : Collision Course offers further proof that not even the healthiest box office receipts can keep a franchise from slouching toward creative extinction . \\'\\' Rotten Tomatoes also ranks it as the worst - reviewed film in the Ice Age franchise . On Metacritic , the film has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 27 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews \\'\\' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` B + \\'\\' on an A+ to F scale . </P> <P> Katie Walsh of Los Angeles Times wrote , `` Collision Course is simply a perfunctory , watered - down entry in the series that feels like it should have been released on home video . \\'\\' Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one out of four stars , saying , `` The fifth entry in the Ice Age series is a loud , lazy , laugh - starved cash grab that cynically exploits its target audience ( I use the term advisedly ) by serving them scraps and calling it yummy . \\'\\' </P> <P> Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote , `` The long - running series returns to form with an infectious chatterbox comedy about the end of the world as we know it . \\'\\' </P> <H2> Possible sequel ( edit ) </H2> <P> On the possibility of a potential sequel , in June 2016 , Galen T. Chu , co-director of the film , stated that there were some ideas for the sixth installment . In July 2016 , Bustle noted that the potential of Ice Age 6 actually being produced was relatively high even though it could largely depend on the box office performance of the fifth film . PopWrapped commented on the subject of a sequel in February 2017 , pointing out the fifth film \\'s poor reception and how the franchise was moving further into absurdity and further away from leaving any lasting emotional impact on the audience , and suggesting that the sixth film could `` redeem \\'\\' the franchise by going back to its roots and reintroducing the humans from the original film , particularly the little baby named Roshan , and thereby bring the audience to remember why they loved Ice Age so much in the first place , and maybe end the series on a high note . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Truitt , Brian ( November 5 , 2015 ) . `` Jesse Tyler Ferguson is a limber llama in new \\' Ice Age \\' \\'\\' .

For the first two years of their existence , the club played their home games at the Boston Arena and Boston Garden . With the increasing difficulty of scheduling games at Boston Garden ( owned by the NHL rival Boston Bruins ) , the owners decided to move the team to Hartford , Connecticut , beginning with the 1974 -- 75 season . While waiting for the completion of a new arena in Hartford , the Whalers played the first part of the season at The Big E Coliseum in West Springfield , Massachusetts . On January 11 , 1975 , the team played its first game in front of a sellout crowd at the Hartford Civic Center Coliseum , and would maintain its home there through 1997 . </P> <P> As one of the most stable WHA teams , the Whalers , along with the Edmonton Oilers , Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets , were admitted to the NHL when the rival leagues merged in 1979 . However , under pressure from the extant NHL team in the New England area , the Boston Bruins , the Whalers were compelled to rename the team the Hartford Whalers . The Whalers were never as successful in the NHL as they had been in the WHA , recording only three winning seasons . They peaked in the mid-to - late 1980s , winning their only playoff series in 1986 over the Nordiques before bowing out in the second round to the Montreal Canadiens , taking the Habs to overtime of Game 7 in the process . The next year , the club secured the regular - season Adams Division title , only to fall to the Nordiques in six games in the first round of the playoffs . In 1992 , the Whalers made the playoffs for the final time , but were bounced in the first round in seven games by the Canadiens . Two years later , the team hired Jim Rutherford as general manager , a position that he would hold within the franchise for twenty years . </P> <P> The organization retains many Whaler connections among its off - ice personnel ; in addition to many members of executive management and the coaching staff , broadcasters Chuck Kaiton , John Forslund and Tripp Tracy ( at the time a minor - league player ) , and equipment managers Wally Tatomir , Skip Cunningham and Bob Gorman all made the move to North Carolina with the team . Finally , the old goal horn from the Hartford Civic Center remains in use at PNC Arena . </P> <H3> Move to North Carolina ( 1997 -- 2001 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Whalers were plagued for most of their existence by limited marketability . Hartford was the smallest American market in the league , and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for New York City and Boston teams . It did not help matters that the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the league , seating just over 15,000 people for hockey . The Whalers \\' off - ice problems were magnified when the start of the 1990s triggered a spike in player salaries . </P> In May 1997 , franchise owner Peter Karmanos Jr. announced that the team would move to North Carolina . <P> Despite assurances made when he purchased the team in 1994 that the Whalers would remain in Hartford at least through 1998 , in March 1997 , owner Peter Karmanos announced that the team would move elsewhere after the 1996 -- 97 season because of the team \\'s inability to negotiate a satisfactory construction and lease package for a new arena in Hartford . On May 6 , 1997 , Karmanos announced that the Whalers would move to the Research Triangle area of North Carolina and the new Entertainment and Sports Arena ( ESA ) in Raleigh . Due to the relatively short time frame for the move , Karmanos himself thought of and decided upon the new name for the club , the Carolina Hurricanes , rather than holding a contest as is sometimes done . Later that summer , the team dropped the Whalers \\' colors of blue , green and silver for a new black - and - red scheme , matching the colors of the North Carolina State University Wolfpack , with whose men \\'s basketball team they would share the arena in Raleigh . The Hurricanes inherited the Whalers \\' place in the Northeast Division . </P> <P> Unfortunately for the team , the ESA would not be complete for two more years . The only arena in the Triangle area with an ice plant was 45 - year - old Dorton Arena ; at 5,100 seats , it was completely inadequate even for temporary use . The Hurricanes were thus forced to play home games in Greensboro , 90 minutes west of Raleigh , for their first two seasons after the move . However , the team would be based in Raleigh and practice in nearby Hillsborough -- effectively saddling the Hurricanes with 82 road games for the next two years . This choice was disastrous for the franchise \\'s attendance and reputation . With a capacity of over 21,000 people for hockey , the Greensboro Coliseum was the highest - capacity arena in the NHL . However , Triangle - area fans balked at making the 80 - mile drive down I - 40 to Greensboro . Likewise , fans from the Piedmont Triad mostly refused to support a lame - duck team that had displaced the popular Greensboro / Carolina Monarchs minor - league franchise . As a result , while the opening game drew a sellout ( and is still the largest home crowd in franchise history ) , most games in Greensboro attracted crowds of 10,000 or fewer . The crowds looked even smaller than that in the cavernous environment . Furthermore , only 29 out of 82 games were televised ( over-the - air and cable combined ) , and radio play - by - play coverage on WPTF was often pre-empted by Wolfpack basketball ( for whose broadcasts WPTF was the flagship station ) , leaving these games totally unavailable to those who did not have a ticket . With by far the smallest season - ticket base in the NHL and attendance figures routinely well below the league average , Sports Illustrated ran a story titled `` Natural Disaster \\'\\' , and ESPN anchors mocked the `` Green Acres \\'\\' of empty seats ; in a 2006 interview , Karmanos admitted that `` as it turns out , ( Greensboro ) was probably a mistake . \\'\\' Under the circumstances , the Hurricanes managed to stay competitive , but still finished last in the Northeast Division with 74 points , nine points out of the playoffs . </P> <P> For 1998 -- 99 , the Hurricanes curtained off most of the upper deck , lowering the Coliseum \\'s listed capacity to about 12,000 . Attendance continued to lag ; most games attracted crowds of well under 10,000 . On the ice , however , the \\' Canes were now out of the doldrums ; led by the return of longtime Whalers captain Ron Francis , Keith Primeau \\'s 30 goals and Gary Roberts \\' 178 penalty minutes , they tallied their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1992 . They also won the new Southeast Division by eight points , only their second division title as an NHL team ( following the 1987 Adams Division title as the Whalers ) . However , tragedy struck hours after the team \\'s first - round loss to the Bruins , when defenseman Steve Chiasson was thrown from his pickup truck and killed in a single - vehicle drunk - driving accident . </P> <P> Despite their move to the brand - new ESA , the Hurricanes played lackluster hockey in 1999 -- 2000 , failing to make the playoffs . This season was marked by an ultimately franchise - altering mid-season trade which saw Primeau dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for a return including future captain Rod Brind\\'Amour . In 2000 -- 01 , however , they claimed the eighth seed , nosing out the Boston Bruins , and landed a first - round match - up with the defending champions , the New Jersey Devils . Although the Devils eliminated the Hurricanes in six games , the series is seen as the real `` arrival \\'\\' of hockey in the Triangle . Down 3 -- 0 in the series , the Hurricanes extended it to a sixth game , thereby becoming only the tenth team in NHL history to do so . Game 6 in Raleigh featured their best playoff crowd that year , as well as their loudest . Despite the 5 -- 1 loss , Carolina was given a standing ovation by their home crowd as the game ended , erasing some of the doubts that the city would not warm up to the team . </P> <H3> Stanley Cup Finals and slow starts ( 2001 -- 2006 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Hurricanes made national waves for the first time in the 2002 playoffs . They survived a late charge from the Washington Capitals to win the division , but expectations were low entering the first round against the defending Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Devils . However , Artūrs Irbe and Kevin Weekes were solid in goal , and the Hurricanes won two games in overtime as they defeated the Devils in six games . Their second - round matchup was against the Montreal Canadiens , who were riding a wave of emotion after their captain Saku Koivu \\'s return from cancer treatment . In the third period of Game 4 in Montreal , down 2 -- 1 in the series and 3 -- 0 in the game , Carolina would tie the game and then win on Niclas Wallin \\'s overtime goal . The game became known to Hurricanes fans as the `` Miracle at Molson \\'\\' ; Carolina won the next two games by a combined 13 -- 3 margin over a dejected Habs club to take the series . </P> <P> In the Eastern Conference Finals , Carolina met the heavily favored Toronto Maple Leafs . In Game 6 in Toronto , the Leafs \\' Mats Sundin tied the game with 22 seconds remaining to send it to overtime , where Carolina \\'s Martin Gelinas would score to send the franchise to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance . During this series , several Hurricanes fan traditions drew hockey - wide media attention for the first time : fans met the team at the airport on the return from every road trip , and echoed football - season habits honed for games across the parking lot by hosting massive tailgate parties before each home game , a relative novelty in the cold - weather - centric NHL . Inside the building , the CBC \\'s Don Cherry lauded the RBC Center as `` the loudest building in the NHL \\'\\' , praise that would be echoed in 2006 . </P> <P> In the Stanley Cup Finals , Carolina would face the Detroit Red Wings , thought to be the prohibitive favorite all year . Though the \\' Canes stunned the Wings in Game 1 , when Ron Francis scored in the first minute of overtime , Detroit stormed back to win the next four games . Game 3 in Raleigh featured a triple - overtime thriller eventually won by Detroit \\'s Igor Larionov , the oldest player to score a last - round goal . </P> Eric Staal was drafted by the Hurricanes in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft . He was later named team captain in 2010 . <P> The Hurricanes looked poised to pick up where they left off in 2002 -- 03 , but never recovered from a 10 - loss January and finished dead last in the league with 61 points . After a similarly slow start to the 2003 -- 04 season , Paul Maurice , who had been the team \\'s coach since midway through their next - to - last season in Hartford , was fired and replaced with former New York Islanders bench boss Peter Laviolette . Under Laviolette , Weekes remained tough , but the offense was suspect ; center Josef Vasicek led the team with a mere 19 goals and 26 assists for 45 points . Many of the new fans attracted to the team ( and to hockey itself ) during the 2002 playoff run lost interest and attendance declined . One of the few positive results of these losing years , however , was the team \\'s drafting of future star Eric Staal in 2003 . </P> Stanley Cup champions ( edit ) <P> The outcome of the 2004 -- 05 NHL lockout led to the shrinking of the payroll to $26 million . The Hurricanes , however , turned out to be one of the NHL \\'s biggest surprises , turning in the best season in the franchise \\'s 34 - year history . They finished the regular season with a 52 -- 22 -- 8 record and 112 points , shattering the previous franchise records of 94 points ( in the WHA ) set by the 1972 -- 73 Whalers and 93 points ( in the NHL ) set in 1986 -- 87 . It was the first time ever that the franchise had passed the 50 - win and 100 - point plateaus . The 112 - point figure was good for fourth overall in the league , easily their highest overall finish as an NHL team ( tied with the third - overall Dallas Stars in points , but with one fewer win than the Stars ) and second in the East ( one point behind the Ottawa Senators ) . The Hurricanes also ran away with their third Southeast Division title , finishing 20 points ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning . Attendance increased from 2003 -- 04 , averaging just under 15,600 per game , and the team made a profit for the first time since the move from Hartford . </P> <P> In the playoffs , after losing the first two games of the conference quarterfinal series against the Montreal Canadiens , Laviolette lifted goalkeeper Martin Gerber -- who had been struggling to regain his form after playing through a bout of intestinal flu -- in favor of rookie Cam Ward . The Hurricanes went on to win both games in Montreal , tying up the playoff series and turning the momentum around , winning the series on a Game 6 overtime goal by Cory Stillman . Carolina then faced the New Jersey Devils in the conference semi-finals , which proved surprisingly one - sided , as the Hurricanes beat the Devils in five games . Stillman struck again , once again scoring the series - winning goal . </P> <P> In the Eastern Conference Finals , the Hurricanes faced the Buffalo Sabres , who had finished just one spot behind the Hurricanes in the overall standings . The contentious series saw both coaches -- Lindy Ruff and Laviolette -- taking public verbal shots at each other \\'s team , but in the deciding Game 7 , the Hurricanes rallied with three goals in the third to win by a score of 4 -- 2 . Rod Brind\\'Amour scored the game winner as the Hurricanes reached the Stanley Cup finals for the second time in team history . </P> The Hurricanes celebrate following their game seven victory in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals . <P> The Stanley Cup Finals were against the Edmonton Oilers , the first time in NHL history that two former WHA franchises had played against one another in the finals . The Hurricanes rallied from a 3 -- 0 deficit in Game 1 to win 5 -- 4 after Rod Brind\\'Amour scored with 30 seconds left . In Game 2 , the Hurricanes shelled the Oilers 5 -- 0 to take a two - game lead . The Oilers won Game 3 in Edmonton , 2 -- 1 , as Ryan Smyth scored the game - winning goal with 2 : 47 left to play . Carolina rebounded in Game 4 with a 2 -- 1 victory , and came home with a chance to win the Cup on home ice . However , Game 5 saw the Oilers come back with a stunning 4 -- 3 overtime win on a shorthanded breakaway by Fernando Pisani . In Game 6 in Edmonton , Carolina was soundly defeated 4 -- 0 ; the only bright point for the Hurricanes was the return of forward Erik Cole from a broken neck that had sidelined him since March . In Game 7 , before the second - largest home crowd in franchise history ( 18,978 ) , the Hurricanes won 3 -- 1 , sealing the Hurricanes \\' first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history . Ward was honored with the Conn Smythe Trophy for the playoffs \\' most valuable player , becoming just the fourth rookie to be honored with the award . Several Hurricanes raised the Cup for the first time in their long NHL careers ; Rod Brind\\'Amour and Bret Hedican had both played over 15 years without winning the Cup , while Glen Wesley -- the last remaining Hartford Whaler on the Hurricanes \\' roster -- had waited 18 seasons . On the managerial side , general manager Jim Rutherford finally won the Cup in his twelfth year with the franchise since joining the Whalers in 1994 . </P> <P> The Hurricanes Stanley Cup championship marked the first professional major league sports title for a team from North Carolina . As well , they were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup despite losing at least nine playoff games in that year ; the 2011 Boston Bruins , the 2014 Los Angeles Kings , and the 2017 Pittsburgh Penguins are the only other teams to have accomplished the feat . </P> <H3> Post-championship slump ( 2006 -- 2017 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Hurricanes were unable to follow up their success . Losing four players to free agency in the offseason and 222 - man games to injury during 2006 -- 07 , the team struggled throughout the regular season , and once eliminated in the last game , the Hurricanes finished third in the Southeast and 11th overall in the Eastern Conference . This finish made them the first champions since the 1938 -- 39 Chicago Black Hawks to have failed to qualify for the playoffs both the seasons before and after their championship season , and the third champion overall to not defend its title after both the Black Hawks and the 1995 - 96 New Jersey Devils . In 2007 -- 08 , Carolina again missed out as Washington Capitals stormed back to take the division title on the last day of the season , leaving the Hurricanes second in the division and ninth overall in the conference , and making the \\' Canes only the second club in NHL history to miss the playoffs for two seasons running after a Cup triumph . </P> In 2009 the Hurricanes acquired Jussi Jokinen through a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning . <P> After a slow start to the 2008 -- 09 season , Cup - winning coach Peter Laviolette was fired in early December and replaced by his own predecessor , Paul Maurice . Teetering on the edge of the playoff picture again , the club , on February 7 , acquired utility forward Jussi Jokinen from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Wade Brookbank , Josef Melichar and Carolina \\'s fourth round draft pick in 2009 , then reacquired winger Erik Cole from the Edmonton Oilers at the March trade deadline and proceeded on a 12 -- 3 -- 2 run to close out the season . The stretch run included nine straight wins , matching a franchise record from the 2005 -- 06 season , and capped off a streak of 12 straight home wins , which set a new franchise mark . The team finished sixth in the Eastern Conference with 97 points , the second-most points in franchise history . </P> <P> The Canes \\' 2009 playoff run featured two tight series with dramatic finishes . Game 4 of the first round matchup with the New Jersey Devils saw Stanley Cup playoff history when Jussi Jokinen scored with . 2 seconds left in regulation to win the game , the latest regulation game - winning goal in NHL history . Then , in Game 7 , the Devils took a 3 -- 2 lead into the final two minutes of the game at the Prudential Center in Newark before the \\' Canes struck . With 1 : 20 to play , Tim Gleason saved a puck on his knees at the right point , passed it to Joni Pitkanen on the left boards , who then hit Game 4 hero Jussi Jokinen at the far post for the tying goal . Just 48 seconds later , Chad LaRose sprang Eric Staal for a solo down - ice rush to give the Canes 4 -- 3 game and series wins ; Staal \\'s goal was the latest regulation Game 7 winning goal in playoff history . In the second round matchup with the top - seeded Boston Bruins , the \\' Canes ran out to a 3 -- 1 lead before the Bruins battled back for two wins . In Game 7 in Boston , Scott Walker scored the game and series winner 18 : 46 into overtime to send Carolina to the Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins . The Penguins , though , put a decisive end to the \\' Canes \\' string , sweeping the series 4 -- 0 on the way to their own Stanley Cup championship . </P> <P> As a result of their surprise run , very few changes were made in the off - season . Veterans such as Aaron Ward , Andrew Alberts and Stephane Yelle were brought in to help drive the team further , but things did not go according to plan . The Hurricanes experienced a 14 - game losing streak spanning October and November , and midway through the year , the \\' Canes replaced their only post-lockout captain Rod Brind\\'Amour with Eric Staal . Despite improved play during the second half of the season , they could not overcome the deficit from early on in the season . The Hurricanes would end up with the seventh overall pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft , eventually selecting Jeff Skinner from the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) . Brind\\'Amour retired over the 2010 off - season to take a coaching job with the club . </P> Jeff Skinner was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy for his rookie season performance in the 2010 -- 11 season . <P> The 2010 -- 11 - year was widely expected to be a transitional year from the veteran - heavy , high - salary club that opened 2009 -- 10 to a younger , cheaper base . The \\' Canes , though , contended for a playoff slot for the entire season , aided by Skinner \\'s emergence as an offensive phenomenon who , as the youngest player in the league , would lead all rookies in points . Raleigh hosted the 2011 NHL All - Star Game in January , and Eric Staal captained a team he selected ( opposite a team selected by the Detroit Red Wings \\' Nicklas Lidstrom ) that featured Skinner ( the youngest All - Star in NHL history ) , Cam Ward , and ( for the SuperSkills competition ) defenseman Jamie McBain . The Hurricanes went into the final day of the season able to determine their own fate , but lost 6 -- 2 to the Tampa Bay Lightning to finish ninth in the East . Skinner was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year , the first player in franchise history to receive that honor . </P> <P> In December 2011 , the Carolina Hurricanes fired coach Paul Maurice and hired Kirk Muller . On February 20 , 2012 , the Carolina Hurricanes signed Tim Gleason to a four - year , $16 million extension and two days later , on February 22 , they also signed Tuomo Ruutu to a four - year , $19 million extension . Two months later the Carolina Hurricanes announced that they had signed Jiri Tlusty to a two - year deal that would pay him $1.5 million for 2012 -- 13 and $1.7 million for 2013 -- 14 ( Gleason and Tlusty would eventually be traded to the Washington Capitals and the Winnipeg Jets over the next few seasons ) . Despite the signings of Gleason , Ruutu , and Tlusty , the Hurricanes would finish fifth in the Southeast Division and twelfth in the Eastern Conference during the 2011 -- 12 season , which forced them to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive season . </P> <P> On May 9 , 2012 , the 2006 Stanley Cup Champions Carolina Hurricanes \\' Game 7 victory was recognized as one of the NC Hall of Fame \\'s `` Great Moments \\'\\' series . During the 2012 NHL Entry Draft , the Carolina Hurricanes traded Brandon Sutter , Brian Dumoulin and their 2012 first round draft pick ( Derrick Pouliot ) to the Penguins in exchange for Jordan Staal , uniting the player with his older brother , Eric Staal . On March 25 , 2013 , the Hurricanes signed Alexander Semin to a five - year deal , worth $35 million . However , in the lockout - shortened 2012 -- 13 season , the team would finish third in the Southeast Division and thirteenth in the Eastern Conference , which would make the team miss the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season . </P> Bill Peters was named the head coach of the Hurricanes in June 2014 . He maintained the position until his resignation in April 2018 . <P> Before the 2013 -- 14 season , the Hurricanes were realigned into the new Metropolitan Division . They would finish seventh in the division during the 2013 -- 14 season ( ahead of only the New York Islanders ) and would miss the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season , which prompted management to fire head coach Kirk Muller . In addition , longtime general manager Jim Rutherford was promoted to an advisory role after the season , with longtime Hurricanes star Ron Francis announced as his replacement on April 28 , 2014 . On June 19 , 2014 , Bill Peters was named head coach of the team . During the 2014 -- 15 season , the team finished last in the Metropolitan Division and would miss the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season . After team captain Eric Staal was traded to the New York Rangers at the trade deadline , the team finished sixth in the division during the 2015 -- 16 season . The Hurricanes finished seventh in the division in the 2016 -- 17 season , missing the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season . </P> <H3> Tom Dundon era ( 2018 -- present ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Before the 2017 -- 18 season , the Hurricanes unveiled new uniforms . On July 13 , 2017 , it was reported that Chuck Greenberg had sent Karmanos a letter of intent to buy the team for $500 million . On December 7 , 2017 , it was announced that Thomas Dundon signed an agreement to purchase the Hurricanes , which ensured that the team would not be relocated . The deal was finalized on January 11 , 2018 , with Dundon becoming majority owner and having a 61 percent stake in the team , while Karmanos retained a minority interest . </P> <P> Dundon wasted little time in overhauling the Hurricanes \\' front office . On March 8 , 2018 , the team announced that general manager Ron Francis had been moved to the role of president of hockey operations `` ; however , Sportsnet reporter Elliotte Friedman reported that the `` promotion \\'\\' was likely in name only , noting that `` there were rumblings Francis / Dundon did not see eye - to - eye . \\'\\' Subsequently , coach Bill Peters resigned from his position on April 20 , 2018 to pursue a similar opportunity with the Calgary Flames ( he ultimately replaced Glen Gulutzan as the Flames \\' head coach three days later ) , and the Hurricanes officially fired Francis from the organization altogether on April 30 , 2018 , leaving vacancies in both the head coach and general manager positions . </P> <P> Early in the Hurricanes \\' search for a replacement general manager , it was reported that Dundon \\'s salary offerings for the position could be prohibitive in attracting quality candidates . Sportsnet \\'s Nick Kypreos reported that the Hurricanes were offering `` in the ballpark of $400,000 a year \\'\\' , a fraction of the salary figures of many other teams \\' coaches , let alone those of their general managers , who serve in a higher - ranking position . Leading up to Kypreos \\' report , candidates such as Nashville Predators assistant general manager Paul Fenton , New Jersey Devils assistant general manager Tom Fitzgerald , and Los Angeles Kings assistant general manager Mike Futa had all reportedly passed on the position . </P> <P> Ultimately , on May 8 , 2018 , the Hurricanes announced the hiring of former Atlanta Thrashers general manager Don Waddell as team president and general manager . Waddell had previously been serving as the team \\'s interim general manager since the promotion of Francis . At the same time , it was announced that former team captain Rod Brind\\'Amour had been named head coach , after having served on the team \\'s coaching staff as an assistant coach since 2011 . </P> <H2> Minor league affiliates ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1979 -- 1980 : Springfield Indians </Li> <Li> 1980 -- 1990 : Binghamton Whalers </Li> <Li> 1990 -- 1994 : Springfield Indians </Li> <Li> 1994 -- 1997 : Springfield Falcons </Li> <Li> 1997 -- 1999 : Beast of New Haven </Li> <Li> 1999 -- 2001 : Cincinnati Cyclones </Li> <Li> 2001 -- 2006 : Lowell Lock Monsters </Li> <Li> 2006 -- 2010 : Albany River Rats </Li> <Li> 2010 -- present : Charlotte Checkers </Li> </Ul> <H2> Season - by - season record ( edit ) </H2> <P> This is a list of the last five seasons completed by the Hurricanes .

Often , the two processes consist of an implicit ( automatic ) , unconscious process and an explicit ( controlled ) , conscious process . Verbalized explicit processes or attitudes and actions may change with persuasion or education ; though implicit process or attitudes usually take a long amount of time to change with the forming of new habits . Dual process theories can be found in social , personality , cognitive , and clinical psychology . It has also been linked with economics via prospect theory and behavioral economics , and increasingly in sociology through cultural analysis . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Theories <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Dual process learning model </Li> <Li> 2.2 Dual coding </Li> <Li> 2.3 Dual - process accounts of reasoning <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 Systems <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 2.1 System 1 </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2.2 System 2 in humans </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Social psychology <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Stereotyping </Li> <Li> 3.2 Terror management theory and the dual process model </Li> <Li> 3.3 Dual process and habituation </Li> <Li> 3.4 Dual process and steering cognition </Li> <Li> 3.5 Application in economic behavior </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Evidence <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Belief bias effect </Li> <Li> 4.2 Tests with working memory </Li> <Li> 4.3 fMRI studies </Li> <Li> 4.4 Near - infrared spectroscopy </Li> <Li> 4.5 Matching bias </Li> <Li> 4.6 Evolution </Li> <Li> 4.7 Issues with the dual - process account of reasoning </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Alternative model </Li> <Li> 6 Fuzzy - trace theory </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The foundations of dual process theory likely comes from William James . He believed that there were two different kinds of thinking : associative and true reasoning . James theorized that empirical thought was used for things like art and design work . For James , images and thoughts would come to mind of past experiences , providing ideas of comparison or abstractions . He claimed that associative knowledge was only from past experiences describing it as `` only reproductive \\'\\' . James believed that true reasoning was useful for `` unprecedented situations \\'\\' in which using reasoning to overcome obstacles such as navigation could be overcome with reasoning power of being able to use a map . </P> <P> There are various dual process theories that were produced after William James \\'s work . Dual process models are very common in the study of social psychological variables , such as attitude change . Examples include Petty and Cacioppo \\'s elaboration likelihood model explained briefly below and Chaiken \\'s heuristic systematic model . According to these models , persuasion may occur after either intense scrutiny or extremely superficial thinking . In cognitive psychology , attention and working memory have also been conceptualized as relying on two distinct processes . Whether the focus be on social psychology or cognitive psychology , there are many examples of dual process theories produced throughout the past . The following just show a glimpse into the variety that can be found . </P> <P> Jonathan Evans suggested dual process theory in 1975 . In his theory , there are two distinct types of processes : heuristic processes and analytic processes . He suggested that during heuristic processes , an individual chooses which information is relevant to the current situation . Relevant information is then processed further whereas irrelevant information is not . Following the heuristic processes come analytic processes . During analytic processes , the relevant information that is chosen during the heuristic processes is then used to make judgments about the situation . </P> <P> Richard E. Petty and John Cacioppo proposed a dual process theory focused in the field of social psychology in 1986 . Their theory is called the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion . In their theory , there are two different routes to persuasion in making decisions . The first route is known as the central route and this takes place when a person is thinking carefully about a situation , elaborating on the information they are given , and creating an argument . This route occurs when an individual \\'s motivation and ability are high . The second route is known as the peripheral route and this takes place when a person is not thinking carefully about a situation and uses shortcuts to make judgments . This route occurs when an individual \\'s motivation or ability are low . </P> <P> Steven Sloman produced another interpretation on dual processing in 1996 . He believed that associative reasoning takes stimuli and divides it into logical clusters of information based on statistical regularity . He proposed that how you associate is directly proportional to the similarity of past experiences , relying on temporal and similarity relations to determine reasoning rather than an underlying mechanical structure . The other reasoning process in Sloman \\'s opinion was of the Rule - based system . The system functioned on logical structure and variables based upon rule systems to come to conclusions different from that of the associative system . He also believed that the Rule - based system had control over the associative system , though it could only suppress it . This interpretation corresponds well to earlier work on computational models of dual processes of reasoning . </P> <P> Daniel Kahneman provided further interpretation by differentiating the two styles of processing more , calling them intuition and reasoning in 2003 . Intuition ( or system 1 ) , similar to associative reasoning , was determined to be fast and automatic , usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process . Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate . Reasoning ( or system 2 ) was slower and much more volatile , being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes . </P> <P> Fritz Strack and Roland Deutsch proposed another dual process theory focused in the field of social psychology in 2004 . According to their model , there are two separate systems : the reflective system and the impulsive system . In the reflective system , decisions are made using knowledge and the information that is coming in from the situation is processed . On the other hand , in the impulsive system , decisions are made using schemes and there is little or no thought required . </P> <H2> Theories ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Dual process learning model ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ron Sun proposed a dual process model of learning ( both implicit learning and explicit learning ) . The model ( named CLARION ) re-interpreted voluminous behavioral data in psychological studies of implicit learning and skill acquisition in general . The resulting theory is two - level and interactive , based on the idea of the interaction of one - shot explicit rule learning ( i.e. , explicit learning ) and gradual implicit tuning through reinforcement ( i.e. implicit learning ) , and it accounts for many previously unexplained cognitive data and phenomena based on the interaction of implicit and explicit learning . </P> <H3> Dual coding ( edit ) </H3> <P> Using a somewhat different approach , Allan Paivio has developed a dual - coding theory of information processing . According to this model , cognition involves the coordinated activity of two independent , but connected systems , a nonverbal system and a verbal system that is specialized to deal with language . The nonverbal system is hypothesized to have developed earlier in evolution . Both systems rely on different areas of the brain . Paivio has reported evidence that nonverbal , visual images are processed more efficiently and are approximately twice as memorable . Additionally , the verbal and nonverbal systems are additive , so one can improve memory by using both types of information during learning . </P> <H3> Dual - process accounts of reasoning ( edit ) </H3> Background ( edit ) <P> The dual - process accounts of reasoning posits that there are two systems or minds in one brain . The theory of two distinct kinds of reasoning has been around for as long as documentations about theories of reasoning go . The current theory is that there are two distinctively separate cognitive systems underlying thinking and reasoning and that these different systems were developed through evolution . These systems are often referred to as `` implicit \\'\\' and `` explicit \\'\\' or by the more neutral `` System 1 \\'\\' and `` System 2 , \\'\\' as coined by Stanovich and West . </P> Systems ( edit ) <P> The systems have multiple names by which they can be called , as well as many different properties . </P> <P> Differences between System 1 and System 2 </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> System 1 </Th> <Th> System 2 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Unconscious reasoning </Td> <Td> Conscious reasoning </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mostly involuntary </Td> <Td> Mostly voluntary </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mostly linked to emotions ( `` gut feeling \\'\\' ) </Td> <Td> Mostly detached from emotions </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Implicit </Td> <Td> Explicit </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Automatic </Td> <Td> Controlled </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Low Effort </Td> <Td> High Effort </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Large Capacity </Td> <Td> Small Capacity </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Rapid </Td> <Td> Slow </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Default process ( suppressed by System 2 , intense concentration ) </Td> <Td> Inhibitory ( suppressed by clearing mind , meditation ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Association ( A ↔ B ) </Td> <Td> Implication ( A → B ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Contextualized </Td> <Td> Abstract </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Domain - specific </Td> <Td> Domain - general </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> More subjective , Value - based </Td> <Td> More objective , Fact / Rule - based </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Evolutionarily old </Td> <Td> Evolutionarily recent </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Nonverbal </Td> <Td> Linked to language </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Includes recognition , perception , orientation . </Td> <Td> Includes rule following , comparisons , weighing of options . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Modular Cognition </Td> <Td> Fluid Intelligence </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Independent of working memory . </Td> <Td> Limited by working memory capacity . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Intuitive , Creative </Td> <Td> Logical , Rational </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Metaphorical , Figurative </Td> <Td> Literal , Exact </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> More qualitative </Td> <Td> More quantitative </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Artistic , Aesthetic design </Td> <Td> Scientific , Mathematical , Technical , Formal </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Imaginative </Td> <Td> Realistic </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Daydreaming , Mind wandering </Td> <Td> Working , Paying attention </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Insightful ( Aha moments ) , Radical , Novel </Td> <Td> Methodical , Incremental , Repetitive </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Parallel , Simultaneous , Nonlinear </Td> <Td> Serial , Sequential , Linear </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Top - down , Holistic , Big picture </Td> <Td> Bottom - up , Elemental , Detail - oriented </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Scope , Scale , Context </Td> <Td> Purpose , Objectives , Requirements </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Open - ended , Adaptable </Td> <Td> Closed - ended , Rigid </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Integrative and Separative </Td> <Td> Selective , Discriminative </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Meta , Reflective </Td> <Td> Iterative , Recursive </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Generates ( builds up and breaks down ) and recognizes patterns , concepts , and ideas . </Td> <Td> Manipulates , filters , and uses patterns , concepts , and ideas . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Processes Data ↔ Information . </Td> <Td> Processes Data → Data and Information → Information . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Searches and finds possibilities . </Td> <Td> Examines and executes goals . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Works across multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously . </Td> <Td> Works within a single level of abstraction at a given time . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Synthesis ( Bloom \\'s ) </Td> <Td> Analysis ( Bloom \\'s ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Intuition ( Myers - Briggs ) </Td> <Td> Thinking ( Myers - Briggs ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Genius </Td> <Td> Expertise </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> `` Right brain \\'\\' , `` Lateral thinking \\'\\' </Td> <Td> `` Left brain \\'\\' , `` Vertical thinking \\'\\' </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Default mode network ( Neuroscience ) </Td> <Td> Task - positive network ( Neuroscience ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Connectionism ( Cognitive science ) </Td> <Td> Computationalism ( Cognitive science ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Neural networks </Td> <Td> ( Can be compared to ) Digital logic </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Difficult to measure with tests .

One way for a process to be labeled as automatic is for the person to be unaware of it . There are three ways in which a person may be unaware of a mental process : they can be unaware of the presence of the stimulus ( subliminal ) , how the stimulus is categorized or interpreted ( unaware of the activation of stereotype or trait constructs ) , or the effect the stimulus has on the person \\'s judgments or actions ( misattribution ) . Another way for a mental process to be labeled as automatic is for it to be unintentional . Intentionality refers to the conscious `` start up \\'\\' of a process . An automatic process may begin without the person consciously willing it to start . The third component of automaticity is efficiency . Efficiency refers to the amount of cognitive resources required for a process . An automatic process is efficient because it requires few resources . The fourth component is controllability , referring to the person \\'s conscious ability to stop a process . An automatic process is uncontrollable , meaning that the process will run until completion and the person will not be able to stop it . Bargh ( 1994 ) conceptualizes automaticity as a component view ( any combination awareness , intention , efficiency , and control ) as opposed to the historical concept of automaticity as an all - or - none dichotomy . </P> <P> One takeaway from the psychological research on dual process theory is that our System 1 ( intuition ) is more accurate in areas where we \\'ve gathered a lot of data with reliable and fast feedback , like social dynamics . </P> System 2 in humans ( edit ) <P> System 2 is evolutionarily recent and specific to humans . It is also known as the explicit system , the rule - based system , the rational system , or the analytic system . It performs the more slow and sequential thinking . It is domain - general , performed in the central working memory system . Because of this , it has a limited capacity and is slower than System 1 which correlates it with general intelligence . It is known as the rational system because it reasons according to logical standards . Some overall properties associated with System 2 are that it is rule - based , analytic , controlled , demanding of cognitive capacity , and slow . </P> <H2> Social Psychology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The dual process has impact on social psychology in such domains as stereotyping , categorization , and judgment . Especially , the study of automaticity and of implicit in dual process theories has the most influence on a person \\'s perception . People usually perceive other people \\'s information and categorize them by age , gender , race , or role . According to Neuberg and Fiske ( 1987 ) a perceiver who receives a good amount of information about the target person then will use their formal mental category ( Unconscious ) as a basis for judging the person . When the perceiver is distracted , the perceiver has to pay more attention to target information ( Conscious ) . Categorization is the basic process of stereotyping in which people are categorized into social groups that have specific stereotypes associated with them . It is able to retrieve people \\'s judgment automatically without subjective intention or effort . Attitude can also be activated spontaneously by the object . John Bargh \\'s study offered an alternative view , holding that essentially all attitudes , even weak ones are capable of automatic activation . Whether the attitude is formed automatically or operates with effort and control , it can still bias further processing of information about the object and direct the perceivers \\' actions with regard to the target . According to Shelly Chaiken , heuristic processing is the activation and application of judgmental rules and heuristics are presumed to be learned and stored in memory . It is used when people are making accessible decisions such as `` experts are always right \\'\\' ( system 1 ) and systematic processing is inactive when individuals make effortful scrutiny of all the relevant information which requires cognitive thinking ( system 2 ) . The heuristic and systematic processing then influence the domain of attitude change and social influence . Unconscious thought theory is the counterintuitive and contested view that the unconscious mind is adapted to highly complex decision making . Where most dual system models define complex reasoning as the domain of effortful conscious thought , UTT argues complex issues are best dealt with unconsciously . </P> <H3> Stereotyping ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dual process models of stereotyping propose that when we perceive an individual , salient stereotypes pertaining to them are activated automatically . These activated representations will then guide behavior if no other motivation or cognition take place . However , controlled cognitive processes can inhibit the use of stereotypes when there is motivation and cognitive resources to do so . Devine ( 1989 ) provided evidence for the dual process theory of stereotyping in a series of three studies . Study 1 linked found prejudice ( according to the Modern Racism Scale ) was unrelated to knowledge of cultural stereotypes of African Americans . Study 2 showed that subjects used automatically - activated stereotypes in judgments regardless of prejudice level ( personal belief ) . Participants were primed with stereotype relevant or non-relevant words and then asked to give hostility ratings of a target with an unspecified race who was performing ambiguously hostile behaviors . Regardless of prejudice level , participants who were primed with more stereotype - relevant words gave higher hostility ratings to the ambiguous target . Study 3 investigated whether people can control stereotype use by activating personal beliefs . Low - prejudice participants asked to list African Americans listed more positive examples than did those high in prejudice . </P> <H3> Terror management theory and the dual process model ( edit ) </H3> <P> According to psychologists Pyszczynski , Greenberg , & Solomon , the dual process model , in relation to terror management theory , identifies two systems by which the brain manages fear of death : distal and proximal . Distal defenses fall under the system 1 category because it is unconscious whereas proximal defenses fall under the system 2 category because it operates with conscious thought . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Distal defenses </Th> <Th> Proximal defenses </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Deal with subconscious , abstract ideas of death </Td> <Td> Deal with conscious thoughts of death at the level of a specific threat </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Experiential </Td> <Td> Rational </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Occur when mortality is not salient </Td> <Td> Occur immediately after direct reminder or threat of mortality </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Occur in response to subliminal reminders of death </Td> <Td> Does not occur after subliminal reminders of death </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Operate by self - conception as a part of a death - transcendent reality ( i.e. thinking of oneself as part of a culture that will endure beyond one \\'s own life ) . </Td> <Td> Operate by pushing thoughts of death into the distant future and removing them from conscious thought </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Dual process and habituation ( edit ) </H3> <P> Habituation can be described as decreased response to a repeated stimulus . According to Groves and Thompson , the process of habituation also mimics a dual process . The dual process theory of behavioral habituation relies on two underlying ( non-behavioral ) processes ; depression and facilitation with the relative strength of one over the other determining whether or not habituation or sensitization is seen in the behavior . Habituation weakens the intensity of a repeated stimulus over time subconsciously . As a result , a person will give the stimulus less conscious attention over time . Conversely , sensitization subconsciously strengthens a stimulus over time , giving the stimulus more conscious attention . Though these two systems are not both conscious , they interact to help people understand their surroundings by strengthening some stimuli and diminishing others . </P> <H3> Dual process and steering cognition ( edit ) </H3> <P> According to Walker , system 1 functions as a serial cognitive steering processor for system 2 , rather than a parallel system . In large - scale repeated studies with school students , Walker tested how students adjusted their imagined self - operation in different curriculum subjects of maths , science and English . He showed that students consistently adjust the biases of their heuristic self - representation to specific states for the different curriculum subjects . The model of cognitive steering proposes that , in order to process epistemically varied environmental data , a heuristic orientation system is required to align varied , incoming environmental data with existing neural algorithmic processes . The brain \\'s associative simulation capacity , centered around the imagination , plays an integrator role to perform this function . Evidence for early - stage concept formation and future self - operation within the hippocampus supports the model , . In the cognitive steering model , a conscious state emerges from effortful associative simulation , required to align novel data accurately with remote memory , via later algorithmic processes . By contrast , fast unconscious automaticity is constituted by unregulated simulatory biases , which induce errors in subsequent algorithmic processes . The phrase \\' rubbish in , rubbish out \\' is used to explain errorful heuristic processing : errors will always occur if the accuracy of initial retrieval and location of data is poorly self - regulated . </P> <H3> Application in economic behavior ( edit ) </H3> <P> According to Alos - Ferrer and Strack the dual - process theory has relevance in economic decision - making through the multiple - selves model , in which one person \\'s self - concept is composed of multiple selves depending on the context . An example of this is someone who as a student is hard working and intelligent , but as a sibling is caring and supportive . Decision - making involves the use of both automatic and controlled processes , but also depends on the person and situation , and given a person \\'s experiences and current situation the decision process may differ . Given that there are two decision processes with differing goals one is more likely to be more useful in particular situations . For example , a person is presented with a decision involving a selfish but rational motive and a social motive . Depending on the individual one of the motives will be more appealing than the other , but depending on the situation the preference for one motive or the other may change . Using the dual - process theory it is important to consider whether one motive is more automatic than the other , and in this particular case the automaticity would depend on the individual and their experiences . A selfish person may choose the selfish motive with more automaticity than a non-selfish person , and yet a controlled process may still outweigh this based on external factors such as the situation , monetary gains , or societal pressure . Although there is likely to be a stable preference for which motive one will select based on the individual it is important to remember that external factors will influence the decision . Dual process theory also provides a different source of behavioral heterogeneity in economics . It is mostly assumed within economics that this heterogeneity comes from differences in taste and rationality , while dual process theory indicates necessary considerations of which processes are automated and how these different processes may interact within decision making . </P> <H2> Evidence ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Belief bias effect ( edit ) </H3> <P> A belief bias is the tendency to judge the strength of arguments based on the plausibility of their conclusion rather than how strongly they support that conclusion . Some evidence suggests that this bias results from competition between logical ( System 2 ) and belief - based ( System 1 ) processes during evaluation of arguments . </P> <P> Studies on belief - bias effect were first designed by Jonathan Evans to create a conflict between logical reasoning and prior knowledge about the truth of conclusions . Participants are asked to evaluate syllogisms that are : valid arguments with believable conclusions , valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions , invalid arguments with believable conclusions , and invalid arguments with unbelievable conclusions . Participants are told to only agree with conclusions that logically follow from the premises given . The results suggest when the conclusion is believable , people erroneously accept invalid conclusions as valid more often than invalid arguments are accepted which support unpalatable conclusions . This is taken to suggest that System 1 beliefs are interfering with the logic of System 2 . </P> <H3> Tests with working memory ( edit ) </H3> <P> De Neys conducted a study that manipulated working memory capacity while answering syllogistic problems . This was done by burdening executive processes with secondary tasks . Results showed that when System 1 triggered the correct response , the distractor task had no effect on the production of a correct answer which supports the fact that System 1 is automatic and works independently of working memory , but when belief - bias was present ( System 1 belief - based response was different from the logically correct System 2 response ) the participants performance was impeded by the decreased availability of working memory . This falls in accordance with the knowledge about System 1 and System 2 of the dual - process accounts of reasoning because System 1 was shown to work independent of working memory , and System 2 was impeded due to a lack of working memory space so System 1 took over which resulted in a belief - bias . </P> <H3> FMRI studies ( edit ) </H3> Researcher conducting Functional magnetic resonance imaging test . <P> Vinod Goel and others produced neuropsychological evidence for dual - process accounts of reasoning using fMRI studies . They provided evidence that anatomically distinct parts of the brain were responsible for the two different kinds of reasoning . They found that content - based reasoning caused left temporal hemisphere activation whereas abstract formal problem reasoning activated the parietal system . They concluded that different kinds of reasoning , depending on the semantic content , activated one of two different systems in the brain . </P> <P> A similar study incorporated fMRI during a belief - bias test . They found that different mental processes were competing for control of the response to the problems given in the belief - bias test . The prefrontal cortex was critical in detecting and resolving conflicts , which are characteristic of System 2 , and had already been associated with that System 2 . The ventral medial prefrontal cortex , known to be associated with the more intuitive or heuristic responses of System 1 , was the area in competition with the prefrontal cortex . </P> <H3> Near - infrared spectroscopy ( edit ) </H3> <P> Tsujii and Watanabe did a follow - up study to Goel and Dolan \\'s fMRI experiment . They examined the neural correlates on the inferior frontal cortex ( IFC ) activity in belief - bias reasoning using near - infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . Subjects performed a syllogistic reasoning task , using congruent and incongruent syllogisms , while attending to an attention - demanding secondary task . The interest of the researchers was in how the secondary - tasks changed the activity of the IFC during congruent and incongruent reasoning processes . The results showed that the participants performed better in the congruent test than in the incongruent test ( evidence for belief bias ) ; the high demand secondary test impaired the incongruent reasoning more than it impaired the congruent reasoning . NIRS results showed that the right IFC was activated more during incongruent trials . Participants with enhanced right IFC activity performed better on the incongruent reasoning than those with decreased right IFC activity . This study provided some evidence to enhance the fMRI results that the right IFC , specifically , is critical in resolving conflicting reasoning , but that it is also attention - demanding ; its effectiveness decreases with loss of attention . The loss of effectiveness in System 2 following loss of attention makes the automatic heuristic System 1 take over , which results in belief bias . </P> <H3> Matching bias ( edit ) </H3> <P> Matching bias is a non-logical heuristic . The matching bias is described as a tendency to use lexical content matching of the statement about which one is reasoning , to be seen as relevant information and do the opposite as well , ignore relevant information that does n\\'t match . It mostly affects problems with abstract content . It does n\\'t involve prior knowledge and beliefs but it is still seen as a System 1 heuristic that competes with the logical System 2 . </P> Example of the Wason selection task . <P> The Wason selection task provides evidence for the matching bias . The test is designed as a measure of a person \\'s logical thinking ability . Performance on the Wason Selection Task is sensitive to the content and context with which it is presented . If you introduce a negative component into the conditional statement of the Wason Selection Task , e.g. \\' If there is an A one side of the card then there is not a 3 on the other side \\' , there is a strong tendency to choose cards that match the items in the negative condition to test , regardless of their logical status . Changing the test to be a test of following rules rather than truth and falsity is another condition where the participants will ignore the logic because they will simply follow the rule , e.g. changing the test to be a test of a police officer looking for underaged drinkers . The original task is more difficult because it requires explicit and abstract logical thought from System 2 , and the police officer test is cued by relevant prior knowledge from System 1 . </P> <P> Studies have shown that you can train people to inhibit matching bias which provides neuropsychological evidence for the dual - process theory of reasoning . When you compare trials before and after the training there is evidence for a forward shift in activated brain area . Pre-test results showed activation in locations along the ventral pathway and post-test results showed activation around the ventro - medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate . Matching bias has also been shown to generalise to syllogistic reasoning . </P> <H3> Evolution ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dual - process theorists claim that System 2 , a general purpose reasoning system , evolved late and worked alongside the older autonomous sub-systems of System 1 . The success of Homo sapiens lends evidence to their higher cognitive abilities above other hominids . Mithen theorizes that the increase in cognitive ability occurred 50,000 years ago when representational art , imagery , and the design of tools and artefacts are first documented . She hypothesizes that this change was due to the adaptation of System 2 . </P> <P> Most evolutionary psychologists do not agree with dual - process theorists . They claim that the mind is modular , and domain - specific , thus they disagree with the theory of the general reasoning ability of System 2 . They have difficulty agreeing that there are two distinct ways of reasoning and that one is evolutionarily old , and the other is new . To ease this discomfort , the theory is that once System 2 evolved , it became a \\' long leash \\' system without much genetic control which allowed humans to pursue their individual goals . </P> <H3> Issues with the dual - process account of reasoning ( edit ) </H3> <P> The dual - process account of reasoning is an old theory , as noted above . But according to Evans it has adapted itself from the old , logicist paradigm , to the new theories that apply to other kinds of reasoning as well . And the theory seems more influential now than in the past which is questionable . Evans outlined 5 `` fallacies \\'\\' : </P> <Ol> <Li> All dual - process theories are essentially the same . There is a tendency to assume all theories that propose two modes or styles of thinking are related and so they end up all lumped under the umbrella term of `` dual - process theories \\'\\' . </Li> <Li> There are just two systems underlying System 1 and System 2 processing . There are clearly more than just two cognitive systems underlying people \\'s performance on dual - processing tasks . Hence the change to theorizing that processing is done in two minds that have different evolutionary histories and that each have multiple sub-systems . </Li> <Li> System 1 processes are responsible for cognitive biases ; System 2 processes are responsible for normatively correct responding . Both System 1 and System 2 processing can lead to normative answers and both can involve cognitive biases . </Li> <Li> System 1 processing is contextualised while System 2 processing is abstract . Recent research has found that beliefs and context can influence System 2 processing as well as System 1 . </Li> <Li> Fast processing indicates the use of System 1 rather than System 2 processes . Just because a processing is fast does not mean it is done by System 1 . Experience and different heuristics can influence System 2 processing to go faster . </Li> </Ol> <P> Another argument against dual - process accounts for reasoning which was outlined by Osman is that the proposed dichotomy of System 1 and System 2 does not adequately accommodate the range of processes accomplished . Moshman proposed that there should be four possible types of processing as opposed to two . They would be implicit heuristic processing , implicit rule - based processing , explicit heuristic processing , and explicit rule - based processing . Another fine - grained division is as follows : implicit action - centered processes , implicit non-action - centered processes , explicit action - centered processes , and explicit non-action - centered processes ( that is , a four - way division reflecting both the implicit - explicit distinction and the procedural - declarative distinction ) . </P> <P> In response to the question as to whether there are dichotomous processing types , many have instead proposed a single - system framework which incorporates a continuum between implicit and explicit processes . </P> <H2> Alternative model ( edit ) </H2> <P> The dynamic graded continuum ( DGC ) , originally proposed by Cleeremans and Jiménez is an alternative single system framework to the dual - process account of reasoning . It has not been accepted as better than the dual - process theory ; it is instead usually used as a comparison with which one can evaluate the dual - process model . The DGC proposes that differences in representation generate variation in forms of reasoning without assuming a multiple system framework . It describes how graded properties of the representations that are generated while reasoning result in the different types of reasoning . It separates terms like implicit and automatic processing where the dual - process model uses the terms interchangeably to refer to the whole of System 1 . Instead the DGC uses a continuum of reasoning that moves from implicit , to explicit , to automatic . </P> <H2> Fuzzy - trace theory ( edit ) </H2> <P> According to Charles Brainerd and Valerie Reyna \\'s fuzzy - trace theory of memory and reasoning , people have two memory representations : verbatim and gist . Verbatim is memory for surface information ( e.g. the words in this sentence ) whereas gist is memory for semantic information ( e.g. the meaning of this sentence ) . </P> <P> This dual process theory posits that we encode , store , retrieve , and forget the information in these two traces of memory separately and completely independently of each other . Furthermore , the two memory traces decay at different rates : verbatim decays quickly , while gist lasts longer . </P> <P> In terms of reasoning , fuzzy - trace theory posits that as we mature , we increasingly rely more on gist information over verbatim information . Evidence for this lies in framing experiments where framing effects become stronger when verbatim information ( percentages ) are replaced with gist descriptions . Other experiments rule out predictions of prospect theory ( extended and original ) as well as other current theories of judgment and decision making . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Automatic and controlled processes ( ACP ) </Li> <Li> Cognitive inhibition </Li> <Li> Dual process model of coping </Li> <Li> Dual process theory ( moral psychology ) </Li> <Li> Opponent - process theory </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Vaisey , Stephen ( 2009 - 05 - 01 ) . `` Motivation and Justification : A Dual ‐ Process Model of Culture in Action \\'\\' .

Nobel laureates of 2012 Alvin E. Roth , Brian Kobilka , Robert J. Lefkowitz , David J. Wineland , and Serge Haroche during the ceremony <P> The Nobel Prizes ( Swedish : Nobelpriset , Norwegian : Nobelprisen ) are prizes awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , the Swedish Academy , the Karolinska Institutet , and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals and organizations who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry , physics , literature , peace , and physiology or medicine . They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel , which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation . The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank , the central bank of Sweden , for contributions to the field of economics . Each recipient , or `` laureate \\'\\' , receives a gold medal , a diploma , and a sum of money , which is decided annually by the Nobel Foundation . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Prize </Li> <Li> 2 Laureates </Li> <Li> 3 List of laureates </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Prize </H2> <P> Each prize is awarded by a separate committee ; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics , Chemistry , and Economics , the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine , and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace . Each recipient receives a medal , a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years . In 1901 , the recipients of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK , which is equal to 8,402,670 SEK in December 2017 . In 2017 , the laureates were awarded a prize amount of 9,000,000 SEK . The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10 , the anniversary of Nobel \\'s death . </P> <P> In years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations , the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize . The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II . </P> <H2> Laureates </H2> <P> Between 1901 and 2017 , the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 585 times to 923 people and organizations . With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once , this makes a total of 892 individuals ( including 844 men , 48 women ) and 24 organizations . Four Nobel laureates were not permitted by their governments to accept the Nobel Prize . Adolf Hitler forbade three Germans , Richard Kuhn ( Chemistry , 1938 ) , Adolf Butenandt ( Chemistry , 1939 ) , and Gerhard Domagk ( Physiology or Medicine , 1939 ) , from accepting their Nobel Prizes , and the government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak ( Literature , 1958 ) to decline his award . Two Nobel laureates , Jean - Paul Sartre ( Literature , 1964 ) and Lê Ðức Thọ ( Peace , 1973 ) , declined the award ; Sartre declined the award as he declined all official honors , and Lê declined the award due to the situation Vietnam was in at the time . </P> <P> Six laureates have received more than one prize ; of the six , the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times , more than any other . UNHCR has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice . Also the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Bardeen twice , and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frederick Sanger . Two laureates have been awarded twice but not in the same field : Marie Curie ( Physics and Chemistry ) and Linus Pauling ( Chemistry and Peace ) . Among the 892 Nobel laureates , 48 have been women ; the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie , who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 . She was also the first person ( male or female ) to be awarded two Nobel Prizes , the second award being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry , given in 1911 . </P> <H2> List of laureates </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Physics </Th> <Th> Chemistry </Th> <Th> Physiology or Medicine </Th> <Th> Literature </Th> <Th> Peace </Th> <Th> Economics </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1901 </Td> <Td> Wilhelm Röntgen </Td> <Td> Jacobus Henricus van \\' t Hoff </Td> <Td> Emil Adolf von Behring </Td> <Td> Sully Prudhomme </Td> <Td> Henry Dunant ; Frédéric Passy </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1902 </Td> <Td> Hendrik Lorentz ; Pieter Zeeman </Td> <Td> Hermann Emil Fischer </Td> <Td> Ronald Ross </Td> <Td> Theodor Mommsen </Td> <Td> Élie Ducommun ; Charles Albert Gobat </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1903 </Td> <Td> Henri Becquerel ; Pierre Curie ; Marie Curie </Td> <Td> Svante Arrhenius </Td> <Td> Niels Ryberg Finsen </Td> <Td> Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson </Td> <Td> Randal Cremer </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1904 </Td> <Td> Lord Rayleigh </Td> <Td> William Ramsay </Td> <Td> Ivan Pavlov </Td> <Td> Frédéric Mistral ; José Echegaray </Td> <Td> Institut de Droit International </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1905 </Td> <Td> Philipp Lenard </Td> <Td> Adolf von Baeyer </Td> <Td> Robert Koch </Td> <Td> Henryk Sienkiewicz </Td> <Td> Bertha von Suttner </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1906 </Td> <Td> J.J.

The three were Richard Kuhn , Nobel laureate in Chemistry in 1938 ; Adolf Butenandt , Nobel laureate in Chemistry in 1939 ; and Gerhard Domagk , Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine in 1939 . They were later awarded the Nobel Prize diploma and medal , but not the money . </Li> <Li> In 1948 , the Nobel Prize in Peace was not awarded . The Nobel Foundation \\'s website suggests that it would have been awarded to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , however , due to his assassination earlier that year , it was left unassigned in his honor . </Li> <Li> In 1958 , Russian - born Boris Pasternak , under pressure from the government of the Soviet Union , was forced to decline the Nobel Prize in Literature . </Li> <Li> In 1964 , Jean - Paul Sartre refused to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature , as he had consistently refused all official honors in the past . </Li> <Li> In 1973 , Lê Ðức Thọ declined the Nobel Peace Prize . His reason was that he felt he did not deserve it because although he helped negotiate the Paris Peace Accords ( a cease - fire in the Vietnam War ) , there had been no actual peace agreement . </Li> <Li> In 2010 , Liu Xiaobo was unable to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as he was sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment by the Chinese authorities . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of Nobel laureates by country </Li> <Li> List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation </Li> <Li> Nobel Prize laureates by secondary school affiliation </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Dl> <Dt> General </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> `` All Nobel Laureates in Physics \\'\\' .

Later , there have been speculations that the committee members could have had another deceased peace worker than Gandhi in mind when they declared that there was `` no suitable living candidate \\'\\' , namely the Swedish UN envoy to Palestine , Count Bernadotte , who was murdered in September 1948 . Today , this can be ruled out ; Bernadotte had not been nominated in 1948 .

It is one of the 20th century \\'s most famous and distinctive buildings . </P> <P> Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon , the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon \\'s 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition . The Government of New South Wales , led by the premier , Joseph Cahill , authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction . The government \\'s decision to build Utzon \\'s design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed , including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect \\'s ultimate resignation . </P> <P> The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour , between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove , adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens , and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge . </P> <P> Though its name suggests a single venue , the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually , attended by more than 1.2 million people . Performances are presented by numerous performing artists , including three resident companies : Opera Australia , the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra . As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia , more than eight million people visit the site annually , and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year . The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust , an agency of the New South Wales State Government . </P> <P> On 28 June 2007 , the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site ; having been listed on the ( now defunct ) Register of the National Estate since 1980 , the National Trust of Australia register since 1983 , the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000 , the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003 , and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Description <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Performance venues and facilities </Li> <Li> 1.2 Other facilities </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Construction history <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Origins </Li> <Li> 2.2 Design and construction <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Stage I : Podium </Li> <Li> 2.2. 2 Stage II : Roof </Li> <Li> 2.2. 3 Stage III : Interiors </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.3 Significant changes to Utzon \\'s design </Li> <Li> 2.4 Completion and cost </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Utzon and his resignation </Li> <Li> 4 Architectural design role of Peter Hall </Li> <Li> 5 Opening </Li> <Li> 6 Performance firsts </Li> <Li> 7 Reconciliation with Utzon ; building refurbishment </Li> <Li> 8 Public and commemorative events </Li> <Li> 9 Advertising controversy </Li> <Li> 10 Notable performances </Li> <Li> 11 Awards </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References <Ul> <Li> 13.1 Attribution </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 14 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 15 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Description ( edit ) </H2> <P> The facility features a modern expressionist design , with a series of large precast concrete `` shells \\'\\' , each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres ( 246 ft 8.6 in ) radius , forming the roofs of the structure , set on a monumental podium . The building covers 1.8 hectares ( 4.4 acres ) of land and is 183 m ( 600 ft ) long and 120 m ( 394 ft ) wide at its widest point . It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25 m ( 82 ft ) below sea level . </P> <P> Although the roof structures are commonly referred to as `` shells \\'\\' ( as in this article ) , they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs , not shells in a strictly structural sense . Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance , they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours : glossy white and matte cream . The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper - mill industry . </P> <P> Apart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces , the building \\'s exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana . Significant interior surface treatments also include off - form concrete , Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales , and brush box glulam . </P> <P> Of the two larger spaces , the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells , the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group . The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements , with low entrance spaces , rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers . The smaller venues ( the Drama Theatre , the Playhouse and the Studio ) are within the podium , beneath the Concert Hall . A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant . The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces , and the large stone - paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space . </P> <H3> Performance venues and facilities ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues : </P> <Ul> <Li> Concert Hall : With 2,679 seats , the home of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and used by a large number of other concert presenters . It contains the Sydney Opera House Grand Organ , the largest mechanical tracker action organ in the world , with over 10,000 pipes . </Li> <Li> Joan Sutherland Theatre : A proscenium theatre with 1,507 seats , the Sydney home of Opera Australia and The Australian Ballet . Until 17 October 2012 it was known as the Opera Theatre . </Li> <Li> Drama Theatre : A proscenium theatre with 544 seats , used by the Sydney Theatre Company and other dance and theatrical presenters . </Li> <Li> Playhouse : A non-proscenium end - stage theatre with 398 seats . </Li> <Li> Studio : A flexible space with 280 permanent seats ( some of which can be folded up ) and a maximum capacity of 400 , depending on configuration . </Li> <Li> Utzon Room : A small multi-purpose venue for parties , corporate functions and small productions ( such as chamber music performances ) . </Li> <Li> Recording Studio </Li> <Li> Outdoor Forecourt : A flexible open - air venue with a wide range of configuration options , including the possibility of utilising the Monumental Steps as audience seating , used for a range of community events and major outdoor performances . </Li> </Ul> <P> Other areas ( for example the northern and western foyers ) are also used for performances on an occasional basis . Venues are also used for conferences , ceremonies and social functions . </P> <H3> Other facilities ( edit ) </H3> <P> The building also houses a recording studio , cafes , restaurants , bars and retail outlets . Guided tours are available , including a frequent tour of the front - of - house spaces , and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members . </P> Interior of the Concert Hall <H2> Construction history ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Origins ( edit ) </H3> Bennelong Point with tram depot in the 1920s ( top left - hand side of photograph ) Construction progress in 1966 <P> Planning began in the late 1940s , when Eugene Goossens , the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music , lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions . The normal venue for such productions , the Sydney Town Hall , was not considered large enough . By 1954 , Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Joseph Cahill , who called for designs for a dedicated opera house . It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site : Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the CBD . </P> <P> An international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries , representing architects from 32 countries . The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people , each to be designed for different uses , including full - scale operas , orchestral and choral concerts , mass meetings , lectures , ballet performances , and other presentations . </P> <P> The winner , announced in 1957 , was Jørn Utzon , a Danish architect . According to legend the Utzon design was rescued by noted Finnish - American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 `` rejects \\'\\' . The runner - up was an entry by firm GBQC of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds . Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project . His office moved to Palm Beach , Sydney in February 1963 . </P> <P> Utzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize , architecture \\'s highest honour , in 2003 . The Pritzker Prize citation read : </P> <P> There is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece . It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century , an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world -- a symbol for not only a city , but a whole country and continent . </P> <H3> Design and construction ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Fort Macquarie Tram Depot , occupying the site at the time of these plans , was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959 . It was built in three stages : stage I ( 1959 -- 1963 ) consisted of building the upper podium ; stage II ( 1963 -- 1967 ) the construction of the outer shells ; stage III ( 1967 -- 1973 ) interior design and construction . </P> Stage I : podium ( edit ) <P> Stage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic , monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners . The government had pushed for work to begin early , fearing that funding , or public opinion , might turn against them . However , Utzon had still not completed the final designs . Major structural issues still remained unresolved . By 23 January 1961 , work was running 47 weeks behind , mainly because of unexpected difficulties ( inclement weather , unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater , construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared , changes of original contract documents ) . Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963 . The forced early start led to significant later problems , not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure , and had to be re-built . </P> Stage II : roof ( edit ) Further information : Mathematics and art Construction progress in 1968 <P> The shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry , but , early in the design process , the `` shells \\'\\' were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs . However , engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them . The formwork for using in - situ concrete would have been prohibitively expensive , and , because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms , the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive . </P> Sydney Opera House shell ribs The glazed ceramic tiles of the Sydney Opera House <P> From 1957 to 1963 , the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form ( including schemes with parabolas , circular ribs and ellipsoids ) before a workable solution was completed . The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis , to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected . The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches . The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day , and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day . In mid-1961 , the design team found a solution to the problem : the shells all being created as sections from a sphere . This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould , and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another , to form a spherical section . With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy . It was originally credited to Utzon . Ove Arup \\'s letter to Ashworth , a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee , states : `` Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions . \\'\\' Peter Jones , the author of Ove Arup \\'s biography , states that `` the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise eureka moment ... ; the engineers and some of their associates , with equal conviction , recall discussion in both central London and at Ove \\'s house . \\'\\' </P> <P> He goes on to claim that `` the existing evidence shows that Arup \\'s canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells , from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres . \\'\\' Yuzo Mikami , a member of the design team , presents an opposite view in his book on the project , Utzon \\'s Sphere . It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known , but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon , Arup , and Ronald Jenkins ( partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project ) all played a very significant part in the design development . </P> <P> As Peter Murray states in The Saga of the Sydney Opera House : </P> <P> ... the two men -- and their teams -- enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and , despite many traumas , was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect / engineer collaboration . </P> <P> The design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind - pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds , which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures . </P> <P> The shells were constructed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd , who were also responsible for construction in Stage III . Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on - site factory and also developed the construction processes . The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units ( it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground , instead of being stuck on individually at height ) . Ove Arup and Partners \\' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells , which used an innovative adjustable steel - trussed `` erection arch \\'\\' to support the different roofs before completion . On 6 April 1962 , it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965 . </P> Stage III : interiors ( edit ) The Concert Hall and organ View from the stage of the Concert Hall . View from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre . Interior of the Studio Theatre . <P> Stage III , the interiors , started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963 . However , there was a change of government in 1965 , and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works . Due to the Ministry \\'s criticism of the project \\'s costs and time , along with their impression of Utzon \\'s designs being impractical , this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 ( see below ) . </P> <P> The cost of the project so far , even in October 1966 , was still only $22.9 million , less than a quarter of the final $102 million cost . However , the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant . </P> <P> The second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned . His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall , who became largely responsible for the interior design . Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E.H. Farmer as government architect , D.S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd . </P> <P> Following Utzon \\'s resignation , the acoustic advisor , Lothar Cremer , confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee ( SOHEC ) that Utzon \\'s original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics . According to Peter Jones , the stage designer , Martin Carr , criticised the `` shape , height and width of the stage , the physical facilities for artists , the location of the dressing rooms , the widths of doors and lifts , and the location of lighting switchboards . \\'\\' </P> <H3> Significant changes to Utzon \\'s design ( edit ) </H3> The foyer of the Joan Sutherland Theatre , showing the internal structure and steel framing of the glass curtain walls ; the final constructions were modified from Utzon \\'s original designs The Opera House at sunset <Ul> <Li> The major hall , which was originally to be a multipurpose opera / concert hall , became solely a concert hall , called the Concert Hall . The minor hall , originally for stage productions only , incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre , later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre . As a result , the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large - scale opera and ballet . A theatre , a cinema and a library were also added . These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre `` in the round \\'\\' . These now comprise the Drama Theatre , the Playhouse and the Studio respectively . These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief , which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used . The layout of the interiors was changed , and the stage machinery , already designed and fitted inside the major hall , was pulled out and largely thrown away , as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary Autopsy on a Dream , which `` chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House \\'\\' . </Li> <Li> Externally , the cladding to the podium and the paving ( the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water , but to be left open ) . </Li> <Li> The construction of the glass walls ( Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions , but a different system was designed to deal with the glass ) . </Li> <Li> Utzon \\'s plywood corridor designs , and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls , were scrapped completely . His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000 , which was considered insufficient . Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer , and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good . The subsequent Todd , Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics , particularly for the performing musicians . The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians \\' hearing . The Concert Hall has a very high roof , leading to a lack of early reflections onstage -- perspex rings ( the `` acoustic clouds \\'\\' ) hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an ( unsuccessful ) attempt to address this problem . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Completion and cost ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Opera House was formally completed in 1973 , having cost $ 102 million . H.R. `` Sam \\'\\' Hoare , the Hornibrook director in charge of the project , provided the following approximations in 1973 : Stage I : podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5 m . Stage II : roof shells M.R. Hornibrook ( NSW ) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5 m . Stage III : completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5 m . Separate contracts : stage equipment , stage lighting and organ $9.0 m . Fees and other costs : $16.5 m . </P> <P> The original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of £ 3,500,000 ( $7 million ) and completion date of 26 January 1963 ( Australia Day ) . In reality , the project was completed ten years late and 1,357 % over budget in real terms . </P> <H2> Utzon and his resignation ( edit ) </H2> The building illuminated at night <P> Before the Sydney Opera House competition , Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built . Utzon \\'s submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking . The Assessors Report of January 1957 , stated : </P> <P> The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic . Nevertheless , as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings , we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world . </P> <P> For the first stage , Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client , but , as the project progressed , the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions . They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction . Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design . This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined . The building was unique , and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans . </P> <P> After the 1965 election of the Liberal Party , with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales , the relationship of client , architect , engineers and contractors became increasingly tense . Askin had been a `` vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office . \\'\\' His new Minister for Public Works , Davis Hughes , was even less sympathetic . Elizabeth Farrelly , an Australian architecture critic , wrote that : </P> <P> at an election night dinner party in Mosman , Hughes \\' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon . Hughes had no interest in art , architecture or aesthetics . A fraud , as well as a philistine , he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree . The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance . For him , as for Utzon , it was all about control ; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius . </P> The Opera House seen from the north <P> Differences ensued . One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice , while the clients wanted a system ( notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes ) where architect , contractors , and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately . This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control , with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers ( such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors ) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender . </P> <P> Utzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client \\'s Sydney Opera House Executive Committee ( SOHEC ) . However , he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges , Harry Ingham Ashworth . Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change . </P> <P> Utzon \\'s ability was never in doubt , despite questions raised by Davis Hughes , who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer . Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was `` probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects \\'\\' and : `` The Opera House could become the world \\'s foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head . \\'\\' </P> The Opera House , backed by the Sydney Harbour Bridge , from the eastern Botanic Gardens <P> In October 1965 , Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III . Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds , a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many , despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds \\'s `` knowledge of the design stresses of plywood , was extremely sketchy \\'\\' and that the technical advice was `` elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes . \\'\\' Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup \\'s project engineer Michael Lewis as having `` other agendas \\'\\' . In any case , Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors , and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered . By February 1966 , Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees . Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff . The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation , Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes : `` If you do n\\'t do it , I resign . \\'\\' Hughes replied : `` I accept your resignation . Thank you very much . Goodbye . \\'\\' </P> The Opera House seen from The Rocks The Sydney Opera House during Vivid Sydney ( 2013 ) . <P> Utzon left the project on 28 February 1966 . He said that Hughes \\'s refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as `` Malice in Blunderland \\'\\' . In March 1966 , Hughes offered him a subordinate role as `` design architect \\'\\' under a panel of executive architects , without any supervisory powers over the House \\'s construction , but Utzon rejected this . Utzon left the country never to return . </P> <P> Following the resignation , there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong . The Sydney Morning Herald initially opined : `` No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon . Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW . One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other . \\'\\' On 17 March 1966 , the Herald offered the view that : `` It was not his ( Utzon \\'s ) fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along . \\'\\' </P> <P> The Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture . The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer - aided design to design complex shapes . The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture , such as works of Gehry and blobitecture , as well as most reinforced concrete structures . The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use . </P> <P> It was also a first in mechanical engineering . Another Danish firm , Steensen Varming , was responsible for designing the new air - conditioning plant , the largest in Australia at the time , supplying over 600,000 cubic feet ( 17,000 m ) of air per minute , using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water - cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today . </P> <H2> Architectural design role of Peter Hall ( edit ) </H2> <P> After the resignation of Utzon , the Minister for Public Works , Davis Hughes , and the Government Architect , Ted Farmer , organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion . The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall , Todd , Littlemore partnership . David Littlemore would manage construction supervision , Lionel Todd contract documentation , while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall . </P> <P> Peter Hall ( 1931 -- 1995 ) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University . Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Hellebæk . Returning to Sydney , Hall worked for the Government Architect , a branch of the NSW Public Works Department . While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings , including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales , which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964 . </P> <P> Hall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice . When approached to take on the design role , ( after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined ) , Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position . Utzon reportedly told Hall : he ( Hall ) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back . Hall also sought the advice of others , including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would `` never be his own \\'\\' . </P> <P> Hall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning . Even so , his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House . Upon Utzon \\'s dismissal , a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point . A petition was also circulated , including in the Government Architects office . Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon \\'s reinstatement . </P> <P> When Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966 , he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced . What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity , acoustics and structure . In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief . To bring himself up to speed , Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan , while establishing his team . In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967 . The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall . Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls , their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role . With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants , Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973 . </P> <P> A former Government Architect , Peter Webber , in his book Peter Hall : the Phantom of the Opera House , concludes : when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified ( than Hall ) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House . </P> <H2> Opening ( edit ) </H2> Tourists observing the Opera House . <P> The Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II , Queen of Australia , on 20 October 1973 . A large crowd attended . Utzon was not invited to the ceremony , nor was his name mentioned . The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven \\'s Symphony No. 9 . </P> <H2> Performance firsts ( edit ) </H2> <P> During the construction phase , lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers , with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform , in 1960 . </P> <P> Various performances were presented prior to the official opening : </P> <Ul> <Li> The first solo piano recital was in the Concert Hall on 10 April 1973 , played by Romola Costantino to an invited audience . </Li> <Li> The first opera performed was Sergei Prokofiev \\'s War and Peace , in what was then known as the Opera Theatre on 28 September 1973 , conducted by the Australian Opera \\'s Music Director , Edward Downes . ( It had been intended that Peter Sculthorpe \\'s work Rites of Passage would have this honour , but it was not ready on time . Rites of Passage was premiered almost exactly a year later , on 27 September 1974 . ) </Li> <Li> The first evening performance of an opera was Larry Sitsky \\'s The Fall of the House of Usher , conducted by Rex Hobcroft and paired with Dalgerie by James Penberthy , to a libretto by Mary Durack ; it took place on 25 July 1973 . </Li> <Li> The first public concert in the Concert Hall took place on 29 September 1973 . It was an all - Wagner orchestral concert performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Charles Mackerras and with Birgit Nilsson as the soprano soloist . The first music played was the Prelude to Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg . The concert closed with the Immolation Scene from Götterdämmerung . </Li> </Ul> <P> After the opening : </P> <Ul> <Li> The first violin and piano recital was given by Wanda Wiłkomirska , with pianist Geoffrey Parsons . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Reconciliation with Utzon ; building refurbishment ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the late 1990s , the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building . In 1999 , he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work . </P> The Utzon Room : rebuilt to a design ( and endowed with an original tapestry ) by Utzon <P> In 2004 , the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened , and renamed `` The Utzon Room \\'\\' in his honour . It contains an original Utzon tapestry ( 14.00 x 3.70 metres ) called Homage to Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach . In April 2007 , he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre , as it was then known . Utzon died on 29 November 2008 . </P> <P> A state memorial service , attended by Utzon \\'s son Jan and daughter Lin , celebrating his creative genius , was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances , readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene . </P> <P> Refurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009 , the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999 . Designed by Utzon and his son Jan , the project provided improved ticketing , toilet and cloaking facilities . New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams . The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building \\'s `` accessibility ambassador \\'\\' to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities . </P> <P> On 29 March 2016 , an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier ( 2.18 x 3.55 metres ) , commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called Les Dés Sont Jetés ( The Dice Are Cast ) , was finally unveiled in situ after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years . The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015 . It now hangs in the building \\'s Western Foyer and is accessible to the public . </P> <P> In the second half of 2017 , the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works . The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020 - 2021 . </P> <H2> Public and Commemorative events ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1993 , Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose Icon , a large - scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House </P> <P> During the 2000 Summer Olympics , the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events . The event had a 1.5 km ( 0.9 mi ) swimming loop at Farm Cove , along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event . </P> <P> Since 2013 , a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments ( better known as \\' The Toaster \\' ) , calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group , have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval ( DA ) . In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015 . However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels . The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment . </P> <P> The Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection - screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013 . </P> <P> On 31 December 2013 , the venue \\'s 40th anniversary year , a New Year firework display was mounted for the first time in a decade . The Sydney Opera House hosted an event , \\' the biggest blind date \\' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record . The longest continuous serving employee was commemorated on June 27th 2018 , for 50 years of service . </P> <H2> Advertising controversy ( edit ) </H2> <P> On 5 October 2018 the Opera House chief executive Louise Herron clashed with Sydney radio commentator Alan Jones who called for her sacking for refusing to allow Racing NSW to use the Opera House sails to advertise The Everest horse race . Within hours , NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian overruled Herron . Two days later , Prime Minister Scott Morrison supported the decision , calling the Opera House `` the biggest billboard Sydney has \\'\\' . The NSW Labor party leader , Luke Foley , and senior federal Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese have supported the proposal . The political view is not supported by significant public opinion , with a petition against the advertising collecting over 298,000 names by 9 October 2018 . 235,000 printed petition documents were presented to the NSW parliament in the morning . A survey conducted on 8 October by market research firm Micromex found that 81 % of those surveyed were not supportive of the premier \\'s direction . </P> <H2> Notable performances ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

The L isomer is the one most often ecountered : it occurs naturally in many foods , and is one form ( `` vitamer \\'\\' ) of vitamin C , an essential nutrient for humans and many animals . Deficiency of vitamin C causes scurvy , formerly a major disease of sailors in long sea voyages . It is used in as a food additive and a dietary supplement for its antioxidant properties . The `` D \\'\\' form can be made chemical synthesis but has no significant biological role . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Chemical properties <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Acidity </Li> <Li> 2.2 Salts </Li> <Li> 2.3 Esters </Li> <Li> 2.4 Nucleophilic attack </Li> <Li> 2.5 Oxidation </Li> <Li> 2.6 Other reactions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Uses <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Food additive </Li> <Li> 3.2 Dietary supplement </Li> <Li> 3.3 Niche , non-food uses </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Synthesis <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Industrial preparation </Li> <Li> 4.2 Determination </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes and references </Li> <Li> 7 Further reading </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The antiscorbutic properties of certain foods were demonstrated in the 18th century by James Lind . In 1907 , Axel Holst and Theodor Frølich discovered that the antiscorbutic factor was a water - soluble chemical substance , distinct from the one that prevented beriberi . Between 1928 to 1932 , Albert Szent - Györgyi isolated a candidate for this substance , which he called it `` hexuronic acid \\'\\' , first from plants and later from animal adrenal glands . In 1932 Charles Glen King confirmed that it was indeed the antiscorbutic factor . </P> <P> In 1933 , sugar chemist Walter Norman Haworth , working with samples of `` hexuronic acid \\'\\' that Szent - Györgyi had isolated from paprika and sent him in the previous year , deduced the correct structure and optical - isomeric nature of the compound , and in 1934 reported its first synthesis . In reference to the compound \\'s antiscorbutic properties , Haworth and Szent - Györgyi proposed to rename it `` a-scorbic acid \\'\\' for the compound , and later specifically L - ascorbic acid . Because of their work , in 1937 the Nobel Prizes for chemistry and medicine were awarded to Haworth and Szent - Györgyi , respectively . </P> <H2> Chemical properties ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Acidity ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ascorbic acid is a vinylogous carboxylic acid and forms the ascorbate anion when deprotonated on one of the hydroxyls . This property is characteristic of reductones : enediols with a carbonyl group adjacent to the enediol group , namely with the group -- C ( OH ) = C ( OH ) -- C ( = O ) -- . The ascorbate anion is stabilized by electron delocalization that results from resonance between two forms : </P> <Dl> <Dd> </Dd> </Dl> <P> For this reason , ascorbic acid is much more acidic than would be expected if the compound contained only isolated hydroxyl groups . </P> <H3> Salts ( edit ) </H3> <P> The ascorbate anion forms salts , such as sodium ascorbate , calcium ascorbate , and potassium ascorbate . </P> <H3> Esters ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ascorbic acid can also react with organic acids as an alcohol forming esters such as ascorbyl palmitate and ascorbyl stearate . </P> <H3> Nucleophilic attack ( edit ) </H3> <P> Nucleophilic attack of ascorbic acid on a proton results in a 1 , 3 - diketone : </P> <Dl> <Dd> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Oxidation ( edit ) </H3> Semidehydroascorbate acid radical Dehydroascorbic acid <P> The ascorbate ion is the predominant species at typical biological pH values . It is a mild reducing agent and antioxidant . It is oxidized with loss of one electron to form a radical cation and then with loss of a second electron to form dehydroascorbic acid . It typically reacts with oxidants of the reactive oxygen species , such as the hydroxyl radical . </P> <P> Ascorbic acid is special because it can transfer a single electron , owing to the resonance - stabilized nature of its own radical ion , called semidehydroascorbate . The net reaction is : </P> <Dl> <Dd> RO + C O → RO + C H O → ROH + C H O </Dd> </Dl> <P> On exposure to oxygen , ascorbic acid will undergo further oxidative decomposition to various products including diketogulonic acid , xylonic acid , threonic acid and oxalic acid . </P> <P> Reactive oxygen species are damaging to animals and plants at the molecular level due to their possible interaction with nucleic acids , proteins , and lipids . Sometimes these radicals initiate chain reactions . Ascorbate can terminate these chain radical reactions by electron transfer . The oxidized forms of ascorbate are relatively unreactive and do not cause cellular damage . </P> <P> However , being a good electron donor , excess ascorbate in the presence of free metal ions can not only promote but also initiate free radical reactions , thus making it a potentially dangerous pro-oxidative compound in certain metabolic contexts . </P> <P> Ascorbic acid and its sodium , potassium , and calcium salts are commonly used as antioxidant food additives . These compounds are water - soluble and , thus , can not protect fats from oxidation : For this purpose , the fat - soluble esters of ascorbic acid with long - chain fatty acids ( ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate ) can be used as food antioxidants . </P> <H3> Other reactions ( edit ) </H3> <P> It creates volatile compounds when mixed with glucose and amino acids in 90 ° C . </P> <P> It is a cofactor in tyrosine oxidation . </P> <H2> Uses ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Food additive ( edit ) </H3> <P> The main use of L - ascorbic acid and its salts is as food additives , mostly to combat oxidation . It is approved for this purpose in the EU with E number E300 , USA , , Australia , and New Zealand ) </P> <H3> Dietary supplement ( edit ) </H3> <P> Another major use of L - ascorbic acid is as dietary supplement . </P> <H3> Niche , non-food uses ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Ascorbic acid is easily oxidized and so is used as a reductant in photographic developer solutions ( among others ) and as a preservative . </Li> <Li> In fluorescence microscopy and related fluorescence - based techniques , ascorbic acid can be used as an antioxidant to increase fluorescent signal and chemically retard dye photobleaching . </Li> <Li> It is also commonly used to remove dissolved metal stains , such as iron , from fiberglass swimming pool surfaces . </Li> <Li> In plastic manufacturing , ascorbic acid can be used to assemble molecular chains more quickly and with less waste than traditional synthesis methods . </Li> <Li> Heroin users are known to use ascorbic acid as a means to convert heroin base to a water - soluble salt so that it can be injected . </Li> <Li> As justified by its reaction with iodine , it is used to negate the effects of iodine tablets in water purification . It reacts with the sterilized water , removing the taste , color , and smell of the iodine . This is why it is often sold as a second set of tablets in most sporting goods stores as Portable Aqua - Neutralizing Tablets , along with the potassium iodide tablets . </Li> <Li> Intravenous high - dose ascorbate is being used as a chemotherapeutic and biological response modifying agent . Currently it is still under clinical trials . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Synthesis ( edit ) </H2> <P> Natural biosynthesis of vitamin C occurs in many plants , and animals , by a variety of processes . </P> <H3> Industrial preparation ( edit ) </H3> The outdated , but historically important industrial synthesis of ascorbic acid from glucose via the Reichstein process . <P> Eighty percent of the world \\'s supply of ascorbic acid is produced in China . Ascorbic acid is prepared in industry from glucose in a method based on the historical Reichstein process . In the first of a five - step process , glucose is catalytically hydrogenated to sorbitol , which is then oxidized by the microorganism Acetobacter suboxydans to sorbose . Only one of the six hydroxy groups is oxidized by this enzymatic reaction . From this point , two routes are available . Treatment of the product with acetone in the presence of an acid catalyst converts four of the remaining hydroxyl groups to acetals . The unprotected hydroxyl group is oxidized to the carboxylic acid by reaction with the catalytic oxidant TEMPO ( regenerated by sodium hypochlorite -- bleaching solution ) . Historically , industrial preparation via the Reichstein process used potassium permanganate as the bleaching solution . Acid - catalyzed hydrolysis of this product performs the dual function of removing the two acetal groups and ring - closing lactonization . This step yields ascorbic acid . Each of the five steps has a yield larger than 90 % . </P> <P> A more biotechnological process , first developed in China in the 1960s , but further developed in the 1990s , bypasses the use of acetone - protecting groups . A second genetically modified microbe species , such as mutant Erwinia , among others , oxidises sorbose into 2 - ketogluconic acid ( 2 - KGA ) , which can then undergo ring - closing lactonization via dehydration . This method is used in the predominant process used by the ascorbic acid industry in China , which supplies 80 % of world \\'s ascorbic acid . American and Chinese researchers are competing to engineer a mutant that can carry out a one - pot fermentation directly from glucose to 2 - KGA , bypassing both the need for a second fermentation and the need to reduce glucose to sorbitol . </P> <P> There exists a D - ascorbic acid , which does not occur in nature but can be synthesized artificially . To be specific , L - ascorbate is known to participate in many specific enzyme reactions that require the correct enantiomer ( L - ascorbate and not D - ascorbate ) . L - Ascorbic acid has a specific rotation of ( α ) = + 23 ° . </P> <H3> Determination ( edit ) </H3> <P> The traditional way to analyze the ascorbic acid content is the process of titration with an oxidizing agent , and several procedures have been developed . </P> <P> The popular iodometry approach uses iodine in the presence of a starch indicator . Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid , and , when all the ascorbic acid has reacted , the iodine is then in excess , forming a blue - black complex with the starch indicator . This indicates the end - point of the titration . </P> <P> As an alternative , ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess , followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator . </P> <P> This iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution . Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine , which reacts with ascorbic acid . The end of process is determined by potentiometric titration in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration . The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday \\'s law . </P> <P> Another alternative uses N - bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) as the oxidizing agent , in the presence of potassium iodide and starch . The NBS first oxidizes the ascorbic acid ; when the latter is exhausted , the NBS liberates the iodine from the potassium iodide , which then forms the blue - black complex with starch . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Colour retention agent </Li> <Li> Erythorbic acid : a diastereomer of ascorbic acid . </Li> <Li> Mineral ascorbates : salts of ascorbic acid </Li> <Li> Acids in wine </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes and references ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Safety ( MSDS ) data for ascorbic acid .

The episode , originally titled `` Robin Sparkles \\'\\' , first aired on November 20 , 2006 . The episode received highly positive reviews and features in several lists of the best How I Met Your Mother episodes in the series . The episode led to two recurring jokes and storylines in the show : `` Robin Sparkles \\'\\' , Robin \\'s teenage pop star career , and the Slap Bet , in which Marshall slaps Barney at various points throughout the series . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Production </Li> <Li> 3 Critical response </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Ted , Marshall , Lily , and Barney find out that Robin never goes to malls and refuses to explain why . Marshall posits that Robin was married in a mall in Canada , because whenever asked about Canada , Robin only talks about her friend who got married way too young . Barney , however , believes that the secret is related to pornography . They agree to a slap bet , where the winner of the bet slaps the loser as hard as he can , and appoint Lily as the slap bet commissioner . </P> <P> Ted begins to worry that Robin is married . Ted pesters Robin to reveal if she really got married in Canada . After trying to avoid the issue , Robin tells Ted that she got married in a mall , after which her husband moved to Hong Kong without getting a divorce . Ted promises to keep it a secret but tells the gang after Lily begs him . Marshall slaps Barney . </P> <P> Law student Marshall searches a legal database and tells Ted that there is no record of a marriage license for Robin in Canada . After asking her various questions about her wedding , Ted confronts Robin and she admits she is not married but finds out that Ted told Marshall her supposed secret . She is angry and tells him that she was testing him to see how long it would take him to tell the rest of the gang . She refuses to tell Ted the true reason she avoids malls . Marshall tells Lily that Robin is not married and Lily , as the slap bet commissioner , must allow Barney to slap Marshall three times . </P> <P> Barney reveals that he has uncovered a video of Robin and asks her if the name \\' Robin Sparkles \\' sounded familiar , which worries Robin . Ted tries to stop Barney from playing the video but Robin lets Barney play it . The beginning of the video shows Robin , dressed as a schoolgirl , seductively pleading with a teacher not to give her detention . Barney , supposedly for the sake of Robin \\'s dignity , pauses the video and slaps Marshall . Robin is surprised to learn that the others think that it is porn , and plays the rest of the video : A 1980s - style bubblegum pop music video where a teenage Robin ( referred to as `` Robin Sparkles \\'\\' ) sings `` Let \\'s Go to the Mall \\'\\' . Robin repeatedly sang the Canadian hit on a lengthy tour of malls around the country , causing her to develop a phobia of malls . </P> <P> Lily points out that Barney slapped Marshall without having won the bet and without the permission of the slap bet commissioner . Lily gives Barney a choice : He can be slapped ten times immediately , or five times at any moment Marshall chooses . Barney picks the five slaps . Robin tells Ted that she is glad Ted knows her secret now . They kiss and Marshall suddenly slaps Barney , proclaiming `` That \\'s one \\'\\' . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The episode was originally titled `` Robin Sparkles , \\'\\' but the title was changed to `` Slap Bet \\'\\' in order to avoid giving away the ending . In reruns , CBS used the originally intended `` Robin Sparkles \\'\\' title . In syndication , this episode is titled `` Slap Bet . \\'\\' </P> <P> The menu that Robin makes up when Ted questions her about her wedding was the actual menu at the wedding of writer Kourtney Kang , which took place two weeks prior to the writing of this episode . </P> <P> This is the first appearance of Robin \\'s young bubblegum pop persona , Robin Sparkles . Sparkles appears onscreen again in the season 3 episode `` Sandcastles in the Sand \\'\\' ( also the name of Sparkles \\' music video ) and the season 6 episode `` Glitter \\'\\' . Robin \\'s later grunge persona , Robin Daggers , appears in the season 8 episode `` P.S. I Love You \\'\\' . </P> <H2> Critical response ( edit ) </H2> <P> Staci Krause of IGN gave the episode 8.9 out of 10 , describing it as `` hilarious \\'\\' and `` a good break from the progressive storyline the show usually boasts \\'\\' . Krause said the `` scene - stealing moment \\'\\' was when the characters realized the video of Robin was a music video and described the video as `` a very tongue - in - cheek homage to 80s pop in America \\'\\' . Later , in IGN \\'s list of the 10 best How I Met Your Mother episodes , `` Slap Bet \\'\\' was selected as the best episode because `` it introduced one of the show \\'s most notable and iconic recurring bits : the titular `` Slap Bet \\'\\' and `` it gave rise to Robin \\'s teen pop star alter ego \\'\\' . The music video was described as the `` ultimate gift \\'\\' to television . </P> <P> In 2010 , Joyce Eng of TV Guide called the episode `` possibly the show \\'s finest half - hour \\'\\' and said , `` nothing will ever be or beat \\' Slap Bet \\' </P> <P> Miss Alli of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A+ . </P> <P> In 2009 , TV Guide ranked `` Slap Bet \\'\\' # 62 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes . </P> <P> The episode has been included in several lists of the best How I Met Your Mother episodes . It appeared on Radio Times \\' list of the top 10 episodes in the series . Josh Lasser of HitFix said `` Slap Bet \\'\\' was the best episode of the show in a list of the top 10 episodes . Digital Spy rated the episode fourth - best . </P> <P> In 2012 , Eric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend chose `` Slap Bet \\'\\' as the best episode of How I Met Your Mother . Eisenberg commented , `` the highlight of `` Slap Bet \\'\\' is the use of misdirection `` , and described Robin \\'s singing as `` maddening and hilarious \\'\\' . He said the song was `` one of the best TV - created pop songs of all time \\'\\' and claimed the episode had `` a wonderful impact on the show at large \\'\\' , explaining that `` both major elements at play in `` Slap Bet \\'\\' have gone on to have effects seen in multiple episodes throughout the program `` . Business Insider noted that the episode received the second - best rating of any How I Met Your Mother episode on IMDb , surpassed only by the 9th season episode How Your Mother Met Me . </P> <P> In 2018 , TheRinger.com listed this episode at # 52 in its list of the best 100 television episodes to have aired since 2000 , and was the only episode of How I Met Your Mother to have made the list . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Joel Keller ( 2007 - 05 - 11 ) . `` Carter Bays of How I Met Your Mother : The TV Squad Interview \\'\\' .
