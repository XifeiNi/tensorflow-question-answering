To contribute:
First, create a new branch for your change in git. Here, we create a branch called mychange (use whatever name you want here), with origin/master as the upstream branch.

```
git checkout -b mychange -t origin/master
```

Commit your change locally in git:
```
git commit -a
```

Merging to master branch will take place in the later stage.
